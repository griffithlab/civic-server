1	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1	ABL1	25	BCR-ABL	The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.		22	23522397	23632600			ENST00000305877.8	75	GRCh37	9	133729451	133763063	ENST00000318560.5	transcript_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:28 UTC	238.0

It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.		14	105246551	105246551	C	T	ENST00000407796.2	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	NC_000014.8:g.105246551C>T,NM_001014432.1:c.49G>A,NP_001014432.1:p.Glu17Lys,ENST00000407796.2:c.49G>A	2017-12-01 14:40:28 UTC	32.5

Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.

This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations.

The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients.

Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.		7	55259515	55259515	T	G	ENST00000275493.2	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	NC_000007.13:g.55259515T>G,NM_005228.4:c.2573T>G,ENST00000275493.2:c.2573T>G,NP_005219.2:p.Leu858Arg	2018-06-04 15:38:46 UTC	326.5
34	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/34	EGFR	1956	T790M	EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.		13	28608219	28608351			ENST00000241453.7	75	GRCh37					inframe_insertion		2017-12-01 14:40:28 UTC	432.5

64	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/64	JAK2	3717	V617F	JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases. It is found in around 98% of patients with polycythemia vera, and just over half of the patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.		9	5073770	5073770	G	T	ENST00000381652.3	75	GRCh37					gain_of_function_variant,missense_variant	NC_000009.11:g.5073770G>T,NM_004972.3:c.1849G>T,NP_004963.1:p.Val617Phe,ENST00000381652.3:c.1849G>T	2017-12-01 14:40:29 UTC	83.0

To better identify EWSR1-ERG in patients, conventional cytogenetics methods were analyzed: FISH and RT-PCR. Ultimately concluding that more than one method is needed to accurately diagnose patients due to the strengths and weaknesses of each individual method.		22	29664007	29683123			ENST00000397938.2	75	GRCh37	21	39751949	39755845	ENST00000398907.1	transcript_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:29 UTC	25.0

TMPRSS2 fusion with ETS family members such as ERG are among the most common. Fusion of TMPRSS2 with ERG may result in overexpression of ERG driven by the TMPRSS2 androgen-responsive promoter elements. Due to the high prevalence of this fusion, it may have diagnostic utility for prostate cancer, especially ERG expression positive prostate cancer.		21	42879877	42879992			ENST00000398585.3	75	GRCh37	21	39751949	39817544	ENST00000398910.1	transcript_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	15.0

199	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/199	IDH2	3418	R172	IDH2 R172 is a gain-of-function mutation commonly observed in acute myeloid leukemia and is enriched in those patients which are cytogenetically normal. R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation "catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).		15	90631837	90631839			ENST00000330062.3	75	GRCh37					protein_altering_variant		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	105.0

The clinical impact of these deletions is unknown for many cancer types however a poor outcome has been observed in leukemia based disease. This gene has been strongly implicated as a regulator for "normal  hematopoiesis". In regards to BCP ALL, mouse models have shown that mutations in IKZF1 are not sufficient in and of themselves to cause disease.  Haploinsuffeciency in combination with BCR-ABL1 however, will accelerate leukemiagenesis possibly indicating that at least in regards to BCP ALL these are secondary events that may be necessary for the development of leukaemic clones.		7	50344378	50472799			ENST00000331340.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_ablation		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	85.0

220	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/220	TERT	7015	PROMOTER MUTATION	TERT promoter mutations are activating and commonly found at two hotspots within the TERT promoter region which occur 124 and 146 base pairs (hg19) upstream of the translation start site. These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.		5	1295161	1295373			ENST00000310581.5	75	GRCh37					regulatory_region_variant		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	80.0

267	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/267	FGFR1	2260	AMPLIFICATION	FGFR1 amplifications are the most common aberrations of the FGFR family in cancer. One study reports FGFR1 aberrations in 3.5% of 4,853 patients of which most are FGFR1 amplifications (Helsten et. al., 2016). Preclinically, FGFR1 amplifications have also been shown to confer sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors (Weiss et. al., 2010). Clinical studies are currently ongoing (e.g. NCT01004224).		8	38268656	38325363			ENST00000425967.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_amplification		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	158.0
268	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/268	FGFR1	2260	EXPRESSION	FGFR1 high expression has been reported in 11.8% (178 patients) of oral squamous cell carcinoma patients, and was enriched in early stages (Freier et. al., 2007). Another study reports FGFR1 expression in 35% of primary HNSSC (353 patients) (Göke et. al., 2015). In both studies, FGFR1 gene amplification and expression do not correlate well with about 35% of samples with FGFR1 amplification overexpressing FGFR1 (Göke et. al., 2015). FGFR1 expression also correlated with sensitivity to FGFR1 inhibitors in preclinical models of lung cancer (Wynes et. al., 2014), HNSSC (Göke et. al., 2015) and urothelial carcinoma (Lamont et. al., 2011).		8	38268656	38325363			ENST00000425967.3	75	GRCh37					N/A		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	46.0
269	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/269	ROS1	6098	REARRANGEMENT	ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that frequently forms gene fusions in several cancer types. Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).		6	117609463	117747018			ENST00000368508.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	68.0

272	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/272	CDKN2A	1029	p16 EXPRESSION	CDKN2A (p16) expression is a surrogate marker of HPV infection in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.		9	21968055	21974865			ENST00000498124.1	75	GRCh37					N/A		2017-12-01 14:40:30 UTC	180.0

306	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/306	ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.		17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37					transcript_amplification		2018-02-15 23:02:15 UTC	822.5

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.		3	178866311	178957881			ENST00000263967.3	75	GRCh37					gain_of_function_variant,transcript_variant		2018-07-12 18:12:39 UTC	274.0

In high-grade gliomas, EGFRvIII has been reported in about 30% of cases with EGFR amplification. The EGFRvIII mutation leads to deletion of the receptor ectodomain exons 2-7. The presence of this variant has been linked with clinical response to EGFR TKI.

414	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/414	ERBB2	2064	Y772_A775DUP	Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain occur at a 2-4% frequency in lung adenocarcinomas, the majority of which are in exon 20 as in-frame duplications or insertions in a small 8 codon region (774-781 or 775-782). These are analogous to the exon 20 alterations found in EGFR TK domain. The M774 insertion, M774insAYVM, represents 62.5% of all HER2 kinase domain mutations identified (when combined with the A775insYVMA mutations as they translate to the identical amino acid sequence changes). As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.		17	37880996	37880997		TACGTGATGGCT	ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37					inframe_insertion	NM_001005862.2:c.2224_2235dupTACGTGATGGCT,ENST00000269571.5:c.2314_2325dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880985_37880996dupTACGTGATGGCT,NC_000017.10:g.37880993_37880994insGCTTACGTGATG	2018-07-05 14:47:19 UTC	36.0

420	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/420	IDH1	3417	R132H	IDH1 R132 mutations have been observed in a number of cancer types, and appear to behave quite differently in different environments. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), IDH1 R132 mutations have been shown to be associated with worse outcome and shorter overall survival. They have also been linked to cytogenetically normal AML, an intermediate risk subtype of the disease. However, in glioblastoma and astrocytoma, patients with IDH1 mutations have shown better overall survival than patients with wild-type IDH1. Also in contrast to AML, in glioblastoma, IDH1 mutations have been associated with the specific cytogenetic abnormalities, 1p and 19q deletions.		2	209113112	209113112	C	T	ENST00000415913.1	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	NM_001282386.1:c.395G>A,NP_005887.2:p.Arg132His,NC_000002.11:g.209113112C>T,ENST00000415913.1:c.395G>A	2018-02-15 14:20:32 UTC	9.0

This fusion is typically associated with favorable prognosis relative to other AML subtypes (including cytogenetically normal); however, the impact of additional mutations in the context of this fusion is incompletely understood. AMLs with this fusion are often grouped with other rearrangements affecting genes encoding core binding factor subunits, referred to as CBF AMLs.		16	67063148	67116211			ENST00000412916.2	75	GRCh37	16	15797029	15820911	ENST00000396324.3	transcript_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:31 UTC	20.0

In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in murine Ba/F3 cells have been shown to be sensitive to the ERBB2 inhibitors (afatinib, lapatinib and neratinib). More recent evidence may show that HER2 acitivating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.		17	37868208	37868208			ENST00000269571.5	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	ENST00000269571.5:c.929C>T,NC_000017.10:g.37868208C>T	2017-12-01 14:40:32 UTC	4.0

499	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/499	ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

500	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/500	ALK	238	EML4-ALK E20;A20	EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20. Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.

503	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/503	ALK	238	EML4-ALK E6;A20	The EML4-ALK variant 3a consists of the ALK kinase domain fused to EML4 exons 1-6, while the 3b variant has an additional 33bp of intronic EML4 sequence between EML4 and ALK regions. The two variants were found to originate from a single genomic rearrangement, and 3a/3b is found in ~ 30% of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Variant 3a has cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. In vitro, these variants have shown sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib but less sensitive than other EML4-ALK variants. The H2228 cell line contains 3a and 3b variants and is described as having cyctostatic response to ALK inhibition as opposed to apoptotic. In a study of 31 NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements, 4/5 patients with the 3a variant showed a partial response while 1 showed progressive disease (the only PD observed). In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.

527	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/527	ALK	238	ALK FUSION I1171	Multiple case reports indicate that the I1171T missense mutation in ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) confers resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but is sensitive to ceritinib treatment. These results have been validated in vitro. In vitro evidence indicates this mutation interferes with alectinib binding the active site of ALK and may explain the sensitivity to the structurally distinct ALK inhibitor ceritinib.		2	29445213	29445213	A	G	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_fusion,missense_variant	ENST00000389048.3:c.3512T>C,NC_000002.11:g.29445213A>G	2017-12-01 14:40:32 UTC	42.5

This mutation shows resistance to crizotinib and alectinib but sensitivity to TAE684, ceritinib and more mild sensitivity to brigatinib. Similar to I1171T, it resides in the ATP pocket of ALK and likely interferes with alectinib and crizotinib binding as a mechanism of resistance.		2	29443679	29443679	C	G	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_fusion,missense_variant	ENST00000389048.3:c.3538G>C,NC_000002.11:g.29443679C>G,NC_000002.11:G.29443679C>G	2017-12-01 14:40:32 UTC	13.0

551	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/551	ALK	238	ALK FUSION F1245C	In neuroblastoma, F1245 is one of three hotspot ALK mutations found at a high frequency. In a case study, a pretreated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient with EML4-ALK F1245C mutation responded well to ceritinib after slow disease progression during crizotinib treatment. Crizotinib resistance was attributed to the F1245C mutation, although the ALK-rearrangement was not sequenced prior to crizotinib treatment. The patient's slow onset of disease progression during crizotinib treatment mirrors preclinical findings that indicate ALK-fusion with F1245C has moderate resistance to crizotinib compared to the fusion alone.		2	29436859	29436859	A	C	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37					transcript_fusion,missense_variant	NM_004304.4:c.3734T>G,NP_004295.2:p.Phe1245Cys,NC_000002.11:g.29436859A>C,ENST00000389048.3:c.3734T>G	2017-12-01 14:40:32 UTC	14.5

These mutations are typically heterozygous and in the absence of JAK2 and MPL mutations. Approximately 80% of observed mutations are type 1 (p.L367fs*46), the result of a 52 bp deletion, or type 2 (p.K385fs*47), the result of a 5-bp TTGTC insertion, and studies have suggested phenotypic and prognostic differences between them.

780	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/780	GLI1	2735	ACTB-GLI1	Fusion of the hedgehog pathway component gene GLI1 to the β-actin gene (ACTB)  has been described as a mechanism of GLI1,and by extension hedgehog pathway, activation. These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.														gene_fusion		2017-12-01 14:40:34 UTC	15.0

It has been widely reported in both familial and sporadic cases of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 with medullary thyroid cancers. Despite extensive WGS and Exome coverage for a combined total of ~150k alleles in the GNOMAD browser, this variant has never been observed.		10	43609070	43609070	G	A	ENST00000355710.3	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	NM_020630.4:c.1826G>A,NC_000010.10:g.43609070G>A,NP_065681.1:p.Cys609Tyr,ENST00000355710.3:c.1826G>A	2017-12-01 14:40:39 UTC	20.0

1300	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1300	TP53	7157	CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT	This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.		17	7577062	7579398			ENST00000269305.4	75								2018-07-06 14:54:43 UTC	15.0

1739	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1739	VHL	7428	R167Q (c.500G>A)	R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.		3	10191507	10191507	G	A	ENST00000256474.2	75	GRCh37					missense_variant	NM_000551.3:c.500G>A,NP_000542.1:p.Arg167Gln,NC_000003.11:g.10191507G>A,ENST00000256474.2:c.500G>A	2018-07-25 20:39:56 UTC	67.5
