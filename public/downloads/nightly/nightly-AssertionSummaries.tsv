These fusions act as driver mutations through ligand-independent dimerization of ALK and constitutive downstream pathway activation. NCCN guideline 6.2020 recommends alectinib as preferred first-line therapy (category 1) for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC based on it's superior performance compared to first-line crizotinib in two phase 3 trials (civic:eid8657 and civic:eid7284). The VENTANA ALK (D5F3) CDx assay is FDA approved as companion diagnostic.	34	1273,1279,1272,1282,7284,8657	499	1	2020-08-14 19:16:45 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/34	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1273,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1279,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1272,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1282,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7284,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8657	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/499	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1
FLT3	2322	ITD	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib	Predictive	Supports	Sensitivity/Response		Tier I - Level A	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	2.2021	true	true	FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in relapsed / refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are sensitive to Gilteritinib, a Type I FLT3 inhibitor.	The constitutively activating FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation appears in approximately 20-30% of AML patients and are associated with high risk, high relapse rates and poor clinical outcome. The type I selective second-generation oral inhibitor, gilteritinib, received initial global approval for use to treat adults with relapsed or refractory (R/R) FLT3 ITD positive AML in Japan in September 2018. Based on interim results of the ADMIRAL trail (Perl AE, et al., 2019), the FDA approved the drug for treatment of adult R/R AML with FLT3 ITD mutations in November 2018. The FDA approved companion diagnostic, LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation assay. NCCN AML guidelines classify gilteritinib as a category 1 recommendation for R/R AML patients harboring FLT3 ITD.	38	7283,8923,8924,7728	55	24	2020-12-03 04:02:19 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/assertions/38	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7283,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8923,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8924,https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7728	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/55	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/24
