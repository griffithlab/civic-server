BRAF	673	V600E	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Vemurafenib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	This preclinical study examined vemurafenib efficacy on various colorectal cancer cell lines and in mouse xenograft experiments. Of the cell lines tested, six harbored BRAF V600E (and WT KRAS) and three harbored BRAF WT (but mutant KRAS). Of the six BRAF V600E expressing cell lines, four were sensitive to vemurafenib (IC50 ranging between 0.025 and 0.35 uM; HT29, Colo205, Colo741, LS411N). Cell lines expressing the BRAF V600E mutation responded better to vemurafenib treatment than cells wildtype for BRAF as measured by reduced cellular proliferation and inhibition of MET and ERK phosphorylation (none of the three BRAF wt cell lines had IC50s less than 10uM). Authors note that one of the vemurafenib-resistant cell lines harboring BRAF V600E (RKO) harbored a concurrent activating PIK3CA H1047R mutation. Nude, athymic mice with HT29 xenografts treated with vemurafenib experienced substantial tumor inhibition and increased lifespan at every dose tested, though authors found 75 mg/kg twice daily to be optimal (95% tumor growth inhibition, 90% increased lifespan compared to vehicle treated controls).	22180495	PubMed		Yang et al., 2012, Cancer Res.		2	accepted	99	12	5	7	140453136	140453136	A	T	ENST00000288602.6					75	GRCh37	BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types.

One patient (who harbored BRAF V600E in low copy number) responded, 11 had stable disease, and 18 progressed.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

The literature also suggests that E545/E542 variants may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., cetuximab). An FDA approved treatment regimen including a targeted PIK3CA inhibitor is available for specific subtypes of breast cancer. While PIK3CA variants are highly prevalent in many other cancer types, targeted therapies for PIK3CA variants are still in early clinical trial phases in other cancer types.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients.

PIK3CA	5290	EXON 10 MUTATION	Colorectal Cancer	9256				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	This study analyzed tumor and patient characteristics from 1,170 colorectal cancer patients derived from the prospective cohort studies: Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow Up Study. PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of patients via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples. Of patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors, 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in the publication, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1). The presence of an exon 10 mutation was not significantly associated with differences in colorectal cancer-specific or overall survival when compared to patients with wt PIK3CA (multivariate, stage-stratified HR = 1.15 vs 1). Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses confirmed that the chimeric protein is expressed in tumor tissue, and a cell culture assay indicated that it retains kinase activity.	24578576	PubMed		Honeyman et al., 2014, Science		4	accepted	405	31	17	19	14628951	14629232			ENST00000254322.2	19	14202500	14218221	ENST00000308677.4	75	GRCh37	This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.

Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.

EGFR	1956	T790M	Lung Cancer	1324		Gefitinib,Multikinase Inhibitor AEE788	Sequential	Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Lung cancers can accumulate activating mutations in oncogenes such as EGFR. The common L858R EGFR mutation has been shown previously to be sensitive to small molecular tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie. erlotinib). In response, tumors may accumulate an additional 'gatekeeper' mutation in EGFR, T790M. Authors show that T790M retain low affinity for gefitinib and that introduction of T790M in the presence of L858R mutant increases the ATP affinity of L858R and activates wild-type EGFR, thus showing that increased ATP affinity is the primary mode of resistance in tumors with T790M, though irreversible ATP inhibitors (ie. HKI-272) are able to overcome this resistance via covalent bonding.	18227510	PubMed		Yun et al., 2008, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

KIT	3815	EXON 11 MUTATION	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective study of 127 pretreatment patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). 85 patients harbored KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs: 71 had an in-frame deletion and 15 had unspecified point mutations (3 codon 557 cases, 3 codon 559 cases, 6 codon 560 cases and 2 codon 576 cases). Of patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutated GISTs, 71 (83.5%) had a partial response, 7 had stable disease, 4 had progressive disease and 3 were nonassessable.  Patients with KIT exon 11 mutations were significantly more likely to have a partial response than those with KIT exon 9 mutations (P=.0006)  or double WT kinases (WT KIT and WT PDGFRA; P < .0001). The presence of a KIT exon 11 mutation was the strongest predictor of response (Hazard ratio= 7.85). Patients harboring KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced longer event free survival (median: 687 days) than those with  KIT exon 9 mutant or double WT kinase GISTs (200 days and 82 days, respectively). Furthermore, patients whose tumors expressed an exon 11 mutant KIT had improved overall survival compared to patients whose tumor expressed an exon 9 mutant KIT (P = .0034)  or double WT kinases (P <.0001).	14645423	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2003, J.

Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

However, p16-positive oropharyngeal HNSSC still had better PFS and OS than p16-positive non-oropharyngeal HNSSC.	25267748	PubMed		Chung et al., 2014, J. Clin.

CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.

Multivariate analysis showed a trend towards better PFS among patients with a G13D mutation (PFS: HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.10; P=0.07; OS: HR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.04-1.54; P=0.13).	26623049	PubMed		Osumi et al., 2015, Mol Clin Oncol		2	accepted	806	81	30	12	25398281	25398281	C	T	ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37	While the KRAS G13 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G12 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, results are conflicting with retrospective analyses suggesting a better response to EGFR-Inhibition. A recent prospective phase-II study (12 patients, Schirripa et. al. 2015) could not reproduce this finding and another prospective phase II trial is currently ongoing.

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

In-vitro experiments confirmed that FOXP3 expression enhance anthracycline efficacy. The in vitro data consisted of testing the sensitivity of various breast cancer cell lines to anthracyclines after treatment with valproic acid (which increases FOXP3 expression).

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

As demonstrated in mouse models (Perrera et al., PNAS 2009) and subsequent clinical trials in human lung adenocarcinoma with these insertions, HER2 YVMA mutants predict response to several targeted HER2 agonists such as afatinib, trastuzumab, neratinib and TDM-1 (trastuzumab emtansine) as monotherapy or combined with specific chemotherapies.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

This mutation was shown to be an activating mutation in an in vitro assay. In the same paper, this mutation (along with other ERBB2 activating mutations) in MCF10A breast cancer cell lines have been shown to be sensitive to the kinase inhibitor neratinib. More recent evidence may show that HER2 activating mutations confer sensitivity to a host of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which is the topic of current clinical trials and research.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Trastuzumab Emtansine		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Efficacy of trastuzumab in HER2 overexpressing NSCLC remains unclear.  In this study using a panel of NSCLC HER2 overexpressing cell lines, antiproliferative effects of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) were observed in a HER2-expression dependant manner, with strongest effects in Calu-3 (high expressing) and no effects in Calu-6 (low expressing).  Trastuzumab did not show notable effects on cell growth in any tested cells.  HER2 positivity in NSCLC is fairly common at 2-20%.  A clinical trial (NCT02289833) is currently underway to asses TDM-1 in HER2 overexpressing lung cancer.	24898067	PubMed		Cretella et al., 2014, Mol.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

ERBB2	2064	AMPLIFICATION	Her2-receptor Positive Breast Cancer	0060079		Docetaxel,Trastuzumab,Pertuzumab	Combination	Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	CLEOPATRA (NCT00567190) was a Phase III, randomized and double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 808 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.  Patients were HER2-positive by IHC3+ or FISH, and patients who had received prior hormonal treatment or adjuvant/neo-adjuvant therapy with or without trastuzumab for longer than 12 months before randomization were also eligible.  The two arms of the study were trastuzumab and docetaxel with either placebo or pertuzumab.  Median PFS in the placebo arm was 12.4 months while in the petuzumab arm 18.5 months was achieved.  Median OS in the control arm was 40.8 months and 56.5 months with pertuzumab.  These strong results make a case for dual antibody blockade in first line treatments of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.	25693012	PubMed		Swain et al., 2015, N. Engl. J. Med.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

Earlier deaths were seen with heavier HER2 expression.  Multivariate Cox regression indicated that shorter survival was associated with higher HER2 expression, and not with age or ethnicity, and that observed differences in survival rates between ethnicities can be ascribed to higher rates of HER2 overexpression in African American patients.  The authors conclude that high HER2 expression in USPC is associated with poor outcome and explains observed differences in outcome between ethnicities.	15746676	PubMed		Santin et al., 2005, Am. J.

HER2 overexpression in USPC is more common in African American women.  This report covered 2 African American patients, the first of which presented high-grade endometrial adenocarcinoma with IHC3+ HER2-positivity as well as positivity by FISH.  Prior treatment involved surgery and chemotherapy.  Treatment with pacitaxel/carboplatin with trastuzumab showed clear clinical improvement assessed by CT scan and drop in CA-125 levels from 988 to 7.9 U/mL.  The second patient had USPC, and was treated with surgery and radiation.  Trastuzumab monotheraby was then administered.  After 7 months of treatment, the patient showed no sign of disease progression and CA-125 had dropped from 144 to 41 U/mL.

During the trial's initial phase, 23 of 132 patients screened met the criteria of IHC2+ or 3+ or FISH positivity for HER2 status.  In the absence of results, the trial entered phase B, where only patients with HER2 amplification by FISH were admitted.  The trial ended early due to poor accrual with 11 of 154 screened meeting the phase B criteria. No major objective tumor responses were observed in the study.  28% of the cancers were of the serous type that had shown trastuzumab response in case studies.

Persistence of NPM1-mutated transcripts in blood was present in 15% of the patients after the second chemotherapy cycle.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined.

HER2 positivity was assessed via FISH. At 2 year follow-up, 70 vs. 109 disease-free survival events had occurred and disease-free survival rates were 93.9% vs. 91.6% (significant) in neratinib vs. placebo groups respectively. Distant disease-free survival and time to distant recurrence were similar in both groups. These results are an interesting contrast to results of long-term adjuvant therapy with trastuzumab (HERA) which did not show significant benefit.	26874901	PubMed		Chan et al., 2016, Lancet Oncol.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

Efficacy of MEK inhibitors (GDC-0623 and G-573) in KRAS-driven tumours is mediated by a hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. This mechanism was distinct from GDC-0973 which is less potent in KRAS mutant tumors. Overall, this work indicates that MEK inhibitors with this mechanism of action will be most effective in patients with both BRAF and KRAS mutations.	23934108	PubMed		Hatzivassiliou et al., 2013, Nature		3	accepted	1140	336	30	12	25362365	25403737			ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:48 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1140	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30

A synthetic lethal screen using a total of 3,530 shRNAs to target 518 human kinases identified ERBB3 knockdown to confer sensitivity of selumetinib-resistant H358 cells (NSCLC cell line) to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. The dual EGFR-ERBB2 inhibitors afatinib and dacomitinib each showed synergy with MEK Inhibition via selumetinib in 4 KRAS mutant cell lines. Western blot evaluation of 9 NSCLC and 12 CRC cell lines showed ERBB3 expression correlated with the synergy score for combination afatinib and trametinib treatment. I.e. the synergy score was low in cells having low basal levels of ERBB3 protein and high for cells having high basal ERBB3 expression. Using selumetinib in patient-derived CRC xenografts or trametinib in NSCLC xenografts, MEK inhibition by selumetinib or trametinib in combination with afatinib more effectively inhibited increases in tumor volume than either monotherapy.	24685132	PubMed		Sun et al., 2014, Cell Rep		3	accepted	1152	289	1733	12	56473645	56497289			ENST00000267101.3					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:38 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1152	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/289	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1733

CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies.

These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.

Results from a mass spectrometry-based assay to evaluate KRAS activity suggests that G12C mutant KRAS is in a “hyperexcitable” rather than a “statically active” state. ARS-853 targets the inactive state and inhibited proliferation in a subset  (3/11) of KRAS G12C mutant cell lines in 2-D growth assays and 11/11 cell lines in soft-agar colony formation and 3-D assays. This effect was specific for KRAS G12C as 12/12 cell lines with other KRAS mutations (including other G12 mutations V, D and A) were not inhibited in either soft-agar assay.  Relative resistance to ARS-853 developed after epidermal growth factor (50 ng/mL) administration and the combination of erlotinib or afatinib (EGFR-inhibitors) with ARS-853 greatly potentiated growth arrest, apoptosis and decrease of PI3K and MAPK-signaling over single-agent ARS-853 treatment, even in the presence of added EGF.	26739882	PubMed		Patricelli et al., 2016, Cancer Discov		3	accepted	1173	78	30	12	25398285	25398285	C	A	ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	In the Phase I study PROFILE 1001 (NCT00585195), a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily for 28 day cycles was established. Among 1,500 advanced NSCLC patients who were screened for ALK-rearrangement using a break-apart FISH assay, 82 patients were eligible for crizotinib treatment. Overall response rate was 57%, with 46 partial responses and one complete response. Since crizotinib inhibits MET, 33 patients with available tissue were screened for MET amplification and were found negative, further indicating that patient response was due to ALK inhibition. 31 patients were tested via RT-PCR for known EML4-ALK fusions, and 13 were shown to have EML4-ALK variant 1, four cases had variant 3, and one instance of variants 2, 3b and 5 were seen. 9 were unidentified, suggesting other fusion partners in these instances.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010, N.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

ALK	238	EML4-ALK	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		WHI-P154		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	A retroviral cDNA expression library was constructed using a lung adenocarcinoma specimen from a 67 year old NSCLC patient, and transfected into mouse 3T3 fibroblasts which were assessed for transformed foci.  Analysis of clones from one transformed focus yielded a novel fusion. This fusion generated a protein with N-terminal consisting of EML4 exons 1-13 and C-terminal consisting of ALK exons 20-29, which comprise the intracellular kinase domain of ALK. In subsequent experiments using EML4-ALK or altered versions, the transforming potential of EML4-ALK was found to be dependent on a functional ALK kinase activity as well as the EML4 basic domain, which was shown to have an important role in EML4-ALK dimer formation.  BA/F3 cells expressing EML4-ALK were able to grow independently of IL3 addition, but addition of ALK inhibitor WHI-P154 induced cell death and inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of EML4-ALK. These results indicated that EML4-ALK may be a driver mutation in NSCLC,  and a target for ALK inhibitor treatment.	17625570	PubMed		Soda et al., 2007, Nature		5	accepted	1188	5	1	2	42396490	42522656			ENST00000318522.5	2	29415640	29446394	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37	The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer. Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.

This patient had adenocarcinoma and a 9 pack year smoking history. Crizotinib treatment duration was over 16 weeks. The patient had multiple lines of prior treatment and showed a partial response to first-time crizotinib treatment. Overall, in the 82 ALK positive patients treated in the study, 46 had partial responses (including this patient) and 1 had a complete response for an overall response rate of 57%.	20979469	PubMed		Kwak et al., 2010, N.

This was called variant 5. Two versions of this variant were seen: 5a consisted of EML4 exon 2 fused to ALK exon 20 while 5b contained a 117bp intronic ALK region between the two exons. Genomic PCR showed that EML4-ALK variant 5 tumor cells contained a single EML4-ALK fusion, suggesting 5a and 5b arise from alternate splicing.  5a and 5b showed in-vitro kinase activity and transformed 3T3 cells in cell culture. 5a and 5b transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors when injected in 8/8 nude mice, but 3T3 transformed with ALK alone did not.  These results suggest that EML4-ALK variant 5 is a driver mutation in lung adenocarcinoma targetable by ALK inhibitors like crizotinib.	18927303	PubMed		Takeuchi et al., 2008, Clin.

Genomic PCR resolved a single breakpoint, but 2 variants of the fusion were observed in cells. Variant 3a consisted of fusion at EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20, while variant 3b fused a 33 bp intronic EML4 region between EML4 exon 6 and ALK exon 20.  3a and 3b showed strong in-vitro kinase activity, transformed mouse 3T3 cells, and 3b-transformed 3T3 cells formed tumors in 8/8 nude mice.  The ALK inhibitor 2,4-pyrimidinediamine inhibited growth of the 3a/b containing NCI-H2228 NSCLC cell line.

In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.

KRAS	3845	EXON 2 MUTATION	Colorectal Cancer	9256		Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	102 mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy were analyzed for 34 hotspot mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF with nanofluidic digital PCR and quantitative PCR. dPCR and qPCR results were correlated to PFS and OS. Analysis of only KRAS exon 2 hotspot mutations showed that patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 19/83) had a hazard ratio of 3.43 for PFS (95% CI, 1.67–7.02; P=0.002) and 2.72 for OS (95% CI, 1.52–4.88; P=0.002) compared to wild-type patients or patients with less than 1% mutant allele fraction. Considering all RAS and BRAF mutations, the patients with more than 1% mutant allele fraction (n = 37/65) had a hazard ratio of 4.52 for PFS (95% CI, 2.25–9.07; P<0.001) and 2.5 for OS (95% CI, 1.57–4.02; P<0.001). ROC analysis showed that a cut-off of 1% for any mutated allele offered the best predictive value.	27037411	PubMed		Azuara et al., 2016, Mol.

TP53	7157	P47S	Cancer	162		Cisplatin		Predictive	Supports	E	Resistance	The P47S (rs1800371) variant of TP53 is observed in 1.5% in African Americans and between 6% and 8% in certain African populations but has not been detected in Caucasian Americans. This paper reports functional studies of this variant. Mouse models with this variant show an increase in spontaneous tumor formation. 16 out of 20 (80%) of S47 homozygous mice developed cancer between 12 and 18 months of age. Cancers predominantly included hepatocellular carcinoma, B-cell lymphoma, and histiocytic sarcoma, as well as other tumor types. In S47/wild-type heterozygote mice an increased cancer incidence, with a predisposition for hepatocellular carcinoma, was also found. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with S47 mutations were significantly less sensitive to cisplatinum treatment compared to TP53 wild-type cells (apoptosis and viability).	27034505	PubMed		Jennis et al., 2016, Genes Dev.		2	accepted	1209	504	45	17	7579548	7579548	G	A	ENST00000269305.4					75	GRCh37		Common Germline	2021-03-31 18:22:40 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1209	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/504	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/45

The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.

ALK	238	CLTC-ALK	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745				Prognostic	Supports	C	Poor Outcome	CLTC-ALK is one of the most common ALK fusions found in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In a retrospective study of 38 patients with ALK-rearranged DLBCL, 3 were CD20 positive. Only one showed cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar staining associated with NPM-ALK, while the others showed granular cytoplasmic ALK stain characteristic for CLTC-ALK.  Seven molecularly characterized cases were positive for CLTC-ALK.  6/7 patients were treated with CHOP chemotherapy with survival of 5, 10, 26 and 27 months, and two alive at end of study, and one CD20 positive patient was treated with CHOP chemotherapy supplemented with CD20-targeted rituximab, with survival of 8 months, resulting in median survival of 26 months for this group.  Although these numbers are not sufficient for statistical comparison, they compare unfavorably to 3.1 year overall survival and 45% 5 year survival of CHOP treated DLBCL patients, and even less favorably to R-CHOP standard of care for CD20 positive DLBCL, suggesting poor prognosis for CLTC-ALK DLBCL and need for updated treatment in this cohort.	19636007	PubMed		Laurent et al., 2009, J.

ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma	0050745		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 27 year old female patient with advanced-stage IV, CD20 negative diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ALK rearrangement was determined by FISH, but the ALK fusion partner was not determined due to limited tissue. The patient underwent treatment with CHOP chemotherapy regimen and radiation but did not respond. The patient progressed following salvage chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. Crizotinib was then administered at 250 mg twice daily, and LDH levels rapidly dropped along with disappearance of palpable lymphadenopathy, but progression ensued after 21 days and the patient died soon after. The authors attribute the short response to crizotinib to the possibility of this tumor having an ALK fusion variant less responsive to ALK inhibition and to a high Ki-67 index in the patient, and deem that despite the brief response, crizotinib shows promise in ALK rearranged DLBCL.	24330038	PubMed		Wass et al., 2014, Eur.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Histopathological analysis showed diffuse tumor cell infiltrate (CD20/EMA negative) with cytoplasmic ALK. RT-PCR indicated CLTC-ALK fusion. The patient was diagnosed with splenic ALK + diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Stage III, Group A with an IPI of 3. CHOP-21 chemotherapy regimen was administered with improvement in abdominal lymph nodes but worsening in retroperitoneal lymph nodes assessed via standardized uptake values. Subsequent ICE chemotherapy regiment relieved some symptoms prompting the patient to refuse further treatment despite other indications of disease progression. Therapy was reinstated after worsening of disease. GEMOX chemotherapy was administered with dexamethasone and 250mg crizotinib twice daily resulting in symptom relief, decreased lymphadenopathy and LDH decline. The disease then progressed and the patient died 2 months after crizotinib initiation. The authors conclude that partial response to crizotinib was observed and that in future trials ALK rearranged DLBCL patients might see increased benefit with earlier application of targeted therapy during the treatment course.	26221234	PubMed		Li et al., 2015, Int J Clin Exp Med		3	accepted	1265	520	1	17	57697219	57768072			ENST00000269122.3	2	29415640	29446394	ENST00000389048.3	75	GRCh37	The t(2;17)(p23;q23) translocation results in the CLTC-ALK fusion protein, the most common ALK fusion observed in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

High B4GALT1 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P<0.001 and P<0.001 in training and validation cohort) and identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for survival (P=0.007 and P=0.002).	27092876	PubMed		Xie et al., 2016, Oncotarget		3	accepted	1278	525	2239	9	33110635	33167354			ENST00000379731.4					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:26 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1278	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/525	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/2239
ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Alectinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this Phase I trial (NCT01588028) in 47 patients, alectinib was assessed for its effectiveness in treating locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC that had progressed or been resistant to crizotinib treatment. ALK rearrangement was assessed via approved break apart FISH kit, and patients with asymptomatic CNS metastases were also included. Patients were divided into different cohorts receiving different doses of alectinib. In the 600 mg cohort (N=13), there were 4 confirmed partial responses, 3 unconfirmed partial responses and 3 instances of stable disease. Also, five of nine patients throughout the cohorts with measurable baseline CNS lesions showed partial response to alectinib. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of alectinib increased linearly with blood alectinib levels, indicating it effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier.	25153538	PubMed		Gadgeel et al., 2014, Lancet Oncol.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

A structural variation in BIM2 (BCL2L11) with an identical 2,903-bp genomic deletion was identified in all three resistant samples. 2,597 healthy individuals were screened and the deletion polymorphism was identified in 12.3% of East Asian Population but 0% in African or European Population. In-vitro, imatinib-induced apoptosis was reduced in cells harboring the BIM deletion polymorphism. Two East Asian CML cohorts (n=203) treated with imatinib were analzed for the polymorphism. Overall odds ratio for resistant disease among subjects with the deletion polymorphism compared to those without it was 2.94 (P = 0.02, 95% CI 1.17–7.43). Patients with the polymorphism, compared to those without, were more likely to be resistant without BCR-ABL mutations than resistant with BCR-ABL mutation or sensitive (odds ratio = 1.90, 95% CI 1.08–4.35).	22426421	PubMed		Ng et al., 2012, Nat.

Introduction of this polymorphism in a previously EGFR-inhibitor sensitive cell line led to TKI-resistance. In 141 NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations, the presence of the polymorphism (N=26) was predictive of a significantly shorter PFS under treatment with EGFR-TKI (6.6 months vs. 11.9 months, p = 0.0027).

The MGH056-1 cell line was derived from this patient, and this cell line was resistant to alectinib. Sequencing of MGH056-1 cells revealed the I1171T mutation in ALK. In cell culture studies Ba/F3 cells with EML4-ALK I1171T required more that 10x the concentration of alectinib to significantly reduce viability that was required for EML4-ALK wild-type expressing cells. Computer simulation studies indicated that the I1171T mutation interfered with alectinib binding at the ALK active site.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

Further testing of this mutation in BaF3 cells revealed that cells expressing EML4-ALk with I1171T mutation required 10x higher concentration to induce cell death than BaF3 cells with wild-type EML4-ALK. In contrast, ceritinib caused loss of viability in EML4-ALK wild-type and I1171T BaF3 cells at comparable concentrations. Ceritinib was also effective at killing MGH056-1 cells that were resistant to alectinib, and reduced Akt and ERK phosphorylation in these cells. Finally, administration of ceritinib to the crizotinib and alectinib resistant patient let to tumor regression and partial response lasting 7 months.	25228534	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2014, Clin.

CDKN2A and p53 are inactivated through HPV proteins E6 and E7 and therefore not altered in expression level in HPV-associated carcinomas. However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings. Predictive information from HPV status have not been established to date. A lack of benefit from EGFR-inhibitors has been proposed by some studies. Other studies were not able to reproduce this finding.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers.

A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib.

A computational method was used to find potential gene fusions which assessed differential exon expression between the 3' and 5' ends of each gene. Two potential fusions were found and assessed using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplifiation of cDNA ends and RT-PCR. The fusions were EML4-ALK variants 1 and 2. Genomic PCR identified fusion breakpoints, and these differed from breakpoints for these EML4-ALK variants reported in NSCLC.	19737969	PubMed		Lin et al., 2009, Mol.

Crizotinib resistant clones were produced from the parental EML4-ALK variant 1 containing cell line H3122 (CR1, CR2, CR3). H3122 CR2 was found to contain the EML4-ALK InsT variant. H3122 CR2 and H3122 cells were similarly sensitized to 17-AAG death with an IC50 value of approximately 5 nM, while control cells without EML4-ALK had IC50 values approximately 10x higher.	22277784	PubMed		Katayama et al., 2012, Sci Transl Med		2	accepted	1349	173	1	2	29445271	29445272		CGT	ENST00000389048.3					75	GRCh37	The ALK fusion variant with insertion of T at amino acid 1151 was found in an ALK rearranged lung adenocarcinoma which had progressed after responding to crizotinib treatment.

In Ba/F3 cells with ectopic EML4-ALK variant 1 G1269A, IC50 of 84 nM was reported with alectinib, which was a 6 fold increase over IC50 for EML4-ALK wild-type. The authors considered a fold difference of 4 to 10 between the alectinib-sensitized wild-type and mutant variant to indicate a resistant mutant variant. In the background of the NPM-ALK fusion, IC50 for G1269A mutation was 104 nM, which was 5.3 fold that reported for NPM-ALK wild-type. Western blots of alectinib treated NPM-ALK G1269A were performed and reduced pALK Y1604 was seen at 300 nM alectinib, and no pALK at 1000 nM.

While there currently are no RET-specific inhibiting agents, promiscuous kinase inhibitors have seen some success in treating RET overactivity. Data suggests however, that the M918T mutation may lead to drug resistance, especially against the VEGFR-inhibitor motesanib. It has also been suggested that RET M819T leads to more aggressive MTC with a poorer prognosis.

FLT3 status should also be evaluated as co-occurence with FLT3-ITD may impact prognosis. Exon 12 mutations have been identified as a predictor of good prognostic outcomes in the absence of FLT3-ITD. Due to their high frequency, NPM1 mutations have been retrospectively analyzed in the context of a number of therapies including variable results following ATRA treatment as well as improved response to high-dose daunorubicin or valproic acid. Additionally, multiple groups have shown increased surface expression of CD33 associated with NPM1 mutation, suggesting these patients may respond to anti-CD33 therapy.

Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.

ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Crizotinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in a subgroup of 82 ALK-positive crizotinib-treated patients enrolled in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT00585195), crizotinib therapy was associated with improved survival. For the crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patient group, 1 year survival was 74% and 2 year overall survival was 54%, compared with 72% and 36% for the control group (ALK-positive crizotinib naive patients).	21933749	PubMed		Shaw et al., 2011, Lancet Oncol.	NCT00585195	3	accepted	1419	499	1	2	29415640	29446394			ENST00000389048.3					75	GRCh37	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

These mutations are typically heterozygous and in the absence of JAK2 and MPL mutations. Approximately 80% of observed mutations are type 1 (p.L367fs*46), the result of a 52 bp deletion, or type 2 (p.K385fs*47), the result of a 5-bp TTGTC insertion, and studies have suggested phenotypic and prognostic differences between them.

Patients were given a chemotherapy regime containing capecitabine, flourouracil and cisplatin with (n=298) or without (n=296) trastuzumab, and had not been previously treated for metastatic cancer.  Study endpoint was overall survival, which was significantly different in the two populations (13.8 months with chemotherapy + trastuzumab and 11.1 months for chemotherapy alone).  The authors conclude that trastuzumab should be a standard option for HER2 positive advanced gastric cancer.	20728210	PubMed		Bang et al., 2010, Lancet	NCT01041404	4	accepted	1499	306	20	17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation "catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

In total only 4 out of 450 tumor and cell line samples had concomitant loss of both genes (p=4.9x10^-7). Cell lines (n=5) with FBXW7 mutations or deletions were significantly sensitive to rapamycin and downregulation of FBXW7 (shRNA) increased the sensitivity to rapamycin. In summary, this evidence suggests that FBXW7 may be a biomarker for cancers sensitivity to inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.	18787170	PubMed		Mao et al., 2008, Science		4	accepted	1632	637	12903	4	153242410	153457253			ENST00000281708.4					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:22:42 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1632	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/637	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/12903

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Microarray analysis showed a downregulation of MYC-dependent genes after treatment. qRT-PCR showed that MYCL1 but not c-MYC and MYCN was expressed in U266 cells and I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1. In contrast, c-MYC but not MYCL was expressed in the other cell lines and I-BET151 induced downregulation of c-MYC.	27276402	PubMed		Suzuki et al., 2016, Anticancer Drugs		1	accepted	1706	670	3738	1	40361098	40367685			ENST00000397332.2					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1706	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/670	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3738

Suppression of SOX10 in melanoma cells confers resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors through activation of TGF-β signalling and upregulation of EGFR and PDGFRB. EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation of melanoma cells in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Melanoma cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are enriched in the presence of vemurafenib. This study finds evidence for SOX10 loss (N=2) and/or activation of TGF-β signalling (N=2) in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples.	24670642	PubMed		Sun et al., 2014, Nature		4	accepted	1710	672	5418	22	38368307	38380544			ENST00000396884.2					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1710	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/672	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5418

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

CYP2D6	1565	LOSS-OF-FUNCTION	Breast Cancer	1612				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	Meta-analysis of 25 studies involving 13,629 women with tamoxifen treated breast cancer. The meta-analysis investigated the association between CYP2D6 genotypes and response to tamoxifen treatment (loss/reduced function vs. unchanged/increased function). The authors examine a prevailing hypothesis that individuals carrying a reduced function CYP2D6 allele have poorer outcomes due to less metabolism of tamoxifen to active metabolites. The study concludes that there is insufficient evidence to support use of CYP2D6 genotyping as a guide for tamoxifen use in breast cancer.	24098545	PubMed		Lum et al., 2013, PLoS ONE		4	accepted	1784	721	1342	22	42522501	42526908			ENST00000360608.5					75	GRCh37		Common Germline	2021-03-31 18:22:41 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/1784	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/721	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1342

Commun.		3	accepted	1844	780	2279													Fusion of the hedgehog pathway component gene GLI1 to the β-actin gene (ACTB)  has been described as a mechanism of GLI1,and by extension hedgehog pathway, activation. These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

HER2 status was determined using immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization and correlated with cetuximab efficacy. Of 142 RAS and BRAF wild-type tumors, we observed 7 cases (4.9%) of HER2 amplification by SISH. After a median follow-up of 13.2 months (range, 1.4-78.1 months), median progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly different according to HER2 status: 3.1 months in patients with HER2 amplification compared with 5.6 months in those with non-amplified HER2 (HR = 2.73; 95% CI = 1.18-6.31; P = 0.019). Overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between groups, although there was a tendency towards shorter OS in patients with HER2-amplified tumors (HR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.61-2.82; 10.1 vs. 13.5 months; P = 0.488).	28223103	PubMed		Jeong et al., 2017, Clin Colorectal Cancer		3	accepted	1993	306	20	17	37856333	37884915			ENST00000269571.5					75	GRCh37	Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

The authors concluded that their findings support the hypothesis that KRAS mutations confer primary resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies and recommend that KRAS status be evaluated prior to panitumumab administration.	18316791	PubMed		Amado et al., 2008, J.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC.

Patients harboring BRAF mutations (total n=24, V600E n=23, D594G n=1) had a lower response rate than did patients with wildtype BRAF (n=326; 2/24 [4.3%] vs 124/326 [38%], OR: 0.15, p=0.0012). BRAF mutant patients also experienced significantly lower disease control rate, PFS, and OS (median 26 vs 54 weeks, HR: 3.03 p<0.0001) in response to cetuximab treatment. In multivariate analysis, the significant associations between BRAF mutations and poor outcome were confirmed. The authors noted that two responders had the following genotypes: V600E mutation in low copy number, and BRAF D594G, and suggested that mutation status of BRAF is more informative than those of NRAS and PIK3CA exon 20 for predicting cetuximab response (second only to KRAS).	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3	accepted	2187	399	5	7	140453136	140481403			ENST00000288602.6					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2187	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/399	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5

Furthermore, there was significantly decreased expression of BBC3, BAX, and GADD45 genes which are downstream of ATM in the DNA damage response. In the above studies, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for p21 induction to confirm wildtype p53.	23585524	PubMed		Navrkalova et al., 2013, Haematologica		4	accepted	2222	178	69	11	108093559	108239826			ENST00000278616.4					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:22:34 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2222	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/178	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/69
ATM	472	R3008C	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	1040		Doxorubicin		Predictive	Supports	D	Resistance	Primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells were taken from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, some of whom had prior therapy. The effect of the R3008C variant on ATM expression was tested by western blot, and the effect on ATM function was tested by treating with doxorubicin to induce double-strand breaks (DSB) and monitoring p21 induction. To confirm wild type p53, parallel cell cultures were treated with fludarabine generating single-strand breaks, in addition to DSB, and monitored for adequate p21 induction. In a patient sample with the R3008C variant of ATM in trans with a wild-type allele, confirmed by sanger sequencing, western blot showed stable ATM expression. Treatment with doxorubicin resulted in a p21 expression level of less than 300% that of untreated wild-type controls. This was much lower than the median expression level of treated controls which was 815% that of untreated controls, supporting resistance. The authors propose that this variant has a dominant-negative effect.	23585524	PubMed		Navrkalova et al., 2013, Haematologica		3	accepted	2223	903	69	11	108236086	108236086	C	T	ENST00000278616.4					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:24 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2223	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/903	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/69

KRAS mutations (n=11) were associated with lack of objective response to drug treatment (0.0% vs. 35.7%, p=0.03), no significant difference in overall survival (19.3 vs. 28.6 months, p=0.47), and shorter median time to progression (2.7 vs. 5.6 months, p=0.003) when compared to wild-type KRAS. Through multivariate analyses, it was shown that KRAS mutations were significant predictors of shorter time to progression (HR: 2.43, 95% CI: 1.23-4.79, p=0.01).	21258250	PubMed		Ludovini et al., 2011, J Thorac Oncol		3	accepted	2385	336	30	12	25362365	25403737			ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:49 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2385	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/336	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30

All four patients' GISTs harbored PDGFRA exon 18 mutatations (one I843_S847delinsM, three D842_H845del). The overall survival was more than 12 months for all four of these patients (mean 40.8 months), which is comparable to patients with WT PDGFRA (49.0months).	18955451	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2008, J.

KIT	3815	D579DEL	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	This prospective study of 127 patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) examined the relationship between kinase (KIT and PDGFRA) genotype and treatment outcome for patients enrolled in a randomized phase II trial of imatinib (CSTI571B 2222). Six GISTs harbored PDGFRA mutations, three of which were deemed imatinib-sensitive by the authors: 1 DIMH842-845 deletion, one I843 deletion, and one V561D point mutation. Two of these patients' GISTs experienced partial responses to imatinib and one experienced progressive disease. Overall, the partial response rate of patients with an imatinib sensitive mutation of KIT or PDGFRA was 75.7% (87 of 115 patients), whereas the partial response rate in patients with no kinase mutation or a previously described imatinib resistant mutation was 0% (0 of 12 patients). The authors concluded that PDGFRA gain-of-function mutations may account for imatinib sensivity in some WT KIT GISTs.	14645423	PubMed		Heinrich et al., 2003, J. Clin.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

Out of 40 BRCA (BRCA1 or BRCA2) mutant patients, 5 had somatic BRCA2 mutation, 4 of which were homozygous mutations and one had unknown zygosity. Confirmed objective response was seen in 80% (4/5) of the somatic BRCA2 mutant subgroup. Authors note that response rate was similar regardless of whether the BRCA mutation was somatic or germline, in BRCA 1 or BRCA 2. In a BRCA wild-type subgroup, with low levels of loss of heterozygosity (LOH), confirmed objective response was observed in 10% (7/70) of the patients. Patients with BRCA mutant tumors experienced significantly longer median progression free survival than patients with BRCA wildtype, LOH low tumors (12.8 vs 5.2 mo, HR: 0.27, P<0.0001).	27908594	PubMed		Swisher et al., 2017, Lancet Oncol.

Of these, 51 patients had variants in KIT and 28 of these were treated with imatinib mesylate at 400 mg orally, twice daily with 25 patients eligible for response evaluation. None of the patients had mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or GNAQ. Two patients achieved a durable complete response, two achieved a durable partial response, and 5 achieved stable disease >12 weeks with a median survival of 46.3 weeks. One patient harboring a somatic D820Y mutation at roughly 50% variant allele frequency (1:1 with wild type) displayed Imatinib mesylate–resistance and disease progression, which is consistent with resistant mechanisms described in Gastro-Intestinal Stromal Tumors.	21642685	PubMed		Carvajal et al., 2011, JAMA	NCT00470470	3	accepted	2886	986	29	4	55599332	55599332	G	T	ENST00000288135.5					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:23 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2886	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/986	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/29

Two of 19 melanomas examined harbored KIT mutations, with one subject harboring a D820Y mutation. Western blotting showed KIT phosphorylation (Y219) in this case and the SM3 cell line harboring the D820Y mutation. The SM3 cell line showed significant growth inhibition with sunitinib exposures of 1uM and 10uM while imatinib showed no activity. The authors comment that this indicates a potential role for sunitinib in growth inhibition of acral melanomas.	19035443	PubMed		Ashida et al., 2009, Int. J.

KIT was amplified in the tumor and harbored the K642E mutation. Post surgery with extensive margins, she was given a dose of anti-CTLA-4 antibody and adjuvant radiation therapy for 2.5 weeks.  Two weeks post radiation she developed nodules in the same region and testing indicated they were malignant melanoma with high KIT expression. She enrolled in a clinical trial with a dose of 400mg imatinib per day (Nov 2006). Less than 4 weeks later, all nodules had disappeared. Upon a lowered dosage to 200mg of imatinib, the nodules returned and subsequently the dosage was increased to 600mg/day. The patient remained melanoma-free on 600mg imatinib until a follow up in Jan 2008.

GNAS	2778	T393C	Melanoma	1909				Prognostic	Supports	B	Better Outcome	This study showed that GNAS1 T393C SNP represents a genetic host factor for predicting tumor progression in patients with malignant melanoma. Carriers of the C-allele showed a significantly more severe tumor progression as estimated from the time period to develop metastasis (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, p = 0.017). Proportions of 5-year metastasis-free intervals were 87.1% for TT genotypes and 66.0% for C-allele carriers. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analysis including tumor stage and melanoma subtype proved the T393C polymorphism to be an independent factor for metastasis (p = 0.012).	21156401	PubMed		Frey et al., 2010, Eur.

MGMT	4255	UNDEREXPRESSION	Glioblastoma Multiforme	3068		Temozolomide		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, patients with low MGMT expression, compared with patients with high MGMT expression, had a significantly higher response rate (55% v 7%, respectively; P = .004) and improved PFS (median, 5.5 v 1.9 months, respectively; P = .009) and OS (median, 16 v 5 months, respectively; P = .003). Among patients with MGMT data available for analysis, radiotherapy was started and completed in 91% of patients with low MGMT expression. In contrast, among patients with high MGMT expression, only 64% started radiotherapy, and 43% completed it. These results suggest that neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be feasible for inoperable glioblastoma patients expressing low levels of MGMT without compromising subsequent treatment with radiotherapy, whereas patients with high MGMT expression are less likely to respond and more likely to experience progression before or during radiotherapy.	17442989	PubMed		Chinot et al., 2007, J.

RET	5979	C609Y	Thyroid Gland Medullary Carcinoma	3973				Predisposing	Supports	B	Pathogenic	Study of a family with three generations of history indicating co-segregation of RET C609Y and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A, many of whom exhibited medullary thyroid cancers specifically.  22 individuals in this family were carriers of C609Y. Of these, 9 exhibited medullary thyroid cancers. While the variant is strongly suspected of being pathogenic for these tumors, this variant appears to result in later onset of cancer than some other variants and the authors recommend delaying prophylactic thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age. In addition to this large family, the authors also provide an extensive review of prior reports of C609 variants, identifying a total of 111 patients from 19 publications, representing 21 affected kindreds and 15 sporadic cases. 89 of these cases had C609Y specifically.  The authors also summarize prior functional work that suggests that C609Y has transforming activity that is significant but not as strong as some other variants. Based on all of this analysis, the authors conclude that C609Y causes medullary thyroid cancers but a milder form than some other variants. Based on this paper, the following ACMG evidence codes seem potentially valid: 'PS1', 'PS3',  'PM5', 'PP1', 'PP4', and 'PP5'.	19472011	PubMed		Calva et al., 2009, Ann. Surg.

MAP2K1	5604	K57N	Lung Adenocarcinoma	3910		Selumetinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas  identified in 2 of 207 primary lung tumors a somatic activating mutation in exon 2 of MEK1 (i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or MAP2K1) that substitutes asparagine for lysine at amino acid 57 (K57N) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase. Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the EGFR signaling pathway (i.e., EGFR, HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF). Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, MEK1 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/F3 cells. A selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, inhibits mutant-induced ERK activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/F3 cells.	18632602	PubMed		Marks et al., 2008, Cancer Res.		2	accepted	2936	1272	31	15	66727455	66727455	G	T	ENST00000307102.5					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:22:41 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/2936	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1272	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/31

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids. CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: T41A (59%), S45F (33%), and S45P (8%).

Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.

We performed a multihistology basket study of AZD5363. 58 patients with advanced solid tumors were treated. In patients with AKT1 E17K-mutant tumors (n = 52) and a median of 5 lines of prior therapy, the median PFS was 5.5 months , 6.6 months and 4.2 months in patients with ER+ breast, gynecologic, and other solid tumors, respectively. In an exploratory biomarker analysis, imbalance of the AKT1 E17K-mutant allele, most frequently caused by copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity targeting the wild-type allele, was associated with longer PFS as was the presence of coincident PI3K pathway hotspot mutations. Persistent declines in AKT1 E17K in cfDNA were associated with improved PFS and response. Responses were not restricted to patients with detectable AKT1 E17K in pretreatment cfDNA.	28489509	PubMed		Hyman et al., 2017, J. Clin.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC. Interestingly PIK3CA mutations in HNSCC have been observed to be absent from a number of ethnic groups including greek, german, and vietnamese populations.

This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, R248 mutations have been shown to confer worse overall survival.

Beta-Catenin deregulation has been commonly identified in sporadic desmoids. CTNNB1 mutations were observed in 117 of 138 (85%) of desmoids. Three discrete mutations in two codons of CTNNB1 exon 3 were identified: T41A (59%), S45F (33%), and S45P (8%). Five-year recurrence-free survival was significantly poorer in S45F-mutated desmoids (23%, P < 0.0001) versus either T41A (57%) or nonmutated tumors (65%).

In an in vitro study, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing EGFR T790M demonstrated resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib and the tool construct AEE788.

While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

EGFR	1956	L858R	Cancer	162		Erlotinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	MCF-7 cells were transduced with YFP tagged EGFR with E746_A750delELREA mutation, or YFP EGFR wildtype, and stained for ectopic YFP EGFR and phospho-Akt as a readout for EGFR pathway activity. Increased p-Akt stain was seen with ectopic mutant EGFR over wildtype cells. Parallel erlotinib incubations of cells with wildtype EGFR induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien only at high concentration (10uM). Addition of erlotinib to mutant EGFR cell incubations reduced p-Akt signal and induced recompartmentalization of ectopic EGFR protien at considerably lower conecntration (100 nM) erlotinib.  These results indicate the EGFR L858R variant as a growth pathway driver targetable by erlotinib.	17877814	PubMed		de Gunst et al., 2007, Mol.

Of those, 7 patients harbored PIK3CA E542K (exon 10), were wt for BRAF, NRAS and PIK3CA, and had individual response data. Two patients had partial response, three had stable disease, and two progressed, resulting in a response rate of 2/7 and a clinical benefit rate of 5/7 according to author criteria. Treatments included cetuximab + irinotecan (n=5), cetuximab + FOLFIRI (n=1), and cetuximab monotherapy (n=1). Median PFS was 34 weeks (17-48 weeks), median OS was 46 weeks (27-91 weeks), and median number of previous chemotherapy lines was 2 (0-4). Median age was 59 years old (53-74), and there were 6 females and one male. Using these and data from the larger cohort, authors concluded that PIK3CA exon 10 (listed as exon 9 in source) mutations are associated with weak or no resistance to cetuximab.	20619739	PubMed		De Roock et al., 2010, Lancet Oncol.		3	accepted	4424	103	37	3	178936082	178936082	G	A	ENST00000263967.3					75	GRCh37	PIK3CA E545K/E542K variants are the second most recurrent PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer and are highly recurrent mutations in many other cancer types. Colorectal cancer patients with the PIK3CA E545K variant, and possibly other variants in the E545 region, may indicate poor prognosis relative to patients with other PIK3CA variants or wild-type PIK3CA. The literature also suggests that E545/E542 variants may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., cetuximab). An FDA approved treatment regimen including a targeted PIK3CA inhibitor is available for specific subtypes of breast cancer. While PIK3CA variants are highly prevalent in many other cancer types, targeted therapies for PIK3CA variants are still in early clinical trial phases in other cancer types.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

The cells were tested for Regorafenib resistance. Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558/T670I mutations (IC50 = 132 +- 25 nM) did show resistance towards  Regorafenib  compared to Ba/F3 cells with del 557-558 alone (IC50 = 30 +- 14 nM). In addition, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Regorafenib. In Regorafenib incubated cells, T670I mutations were seen in approximately 10% of the resistant cell populations.

This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

Tumor tissue for mutational status assessment was obtained from 230 patients on one or more occassions (pre-imatinib, post-imatinib/pre-sunitinib, post-sunitinib). Tissue was assessed for mutations in KIT exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 and in PDGFRA exons 12 and 18.  With sunitinib treatment, patients with a primary (pre-imatinib) KIT exon 9 mutation (n=42) displayed significantly better PFS compared with those with a primary KIT exon 11 mutation (n=143; p = .011),  significantly longer OS (p =.002), and significantly higher ORR (p=.012).

The cells were tested for Imatinib and Sunitinib resistances. GIST-T1/816 cells with 560-578 deletion and D816E mutations were resistant towards Imatinib and Sunitinib (Imatinib IC50: 604 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 3111 nM) compared to GIST-T1 cells with the 560-578 deletion mutation alone (Imatinib IC50: 30 nM and Sunitinib IC50: 15 nM). Imatinib inhibited phosphorylation in KIT and ERK at high concentrations. Sunitinib did not inhibit phosphorylation in KIT, ERK, or AKT at all. Additionally, Ba/F3 cells were mutagenized with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and incubated with varying concentrations of Sunitinib and Imatinib separately. In Imatinib incubated cells, D816E mutations were seen in less than 5% of resistant Ba/F3 cell clones only in the lowest concentration.

It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.

In ER+ tumors, mutations in the ESR1 ligand binding domain have been shown to confer resistance to hormone therapy. This evidence has led to an increased use of targeted sequencing of the estrogen receptor in breast and ovarian cancer. D538G is one of these ligand binding domain mutations, and is commonly implicated in this hormone resistance. Preliminary data suggests ER-degrading agents, such as fulvestrant, may be beneficial in treating ESR1 mutant, hormone resistant breast cancers.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

These data suggest no difference in ORR or PFS with combination therapy of over monotherapy in KRAS mutant and KRAS wild-type advanced NSCLC.	26802155	PubMed		Carter et al., 2016, Ann. Oncol.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

The c.551T>C (p.L184P) mutation was found in a family (Lineage 14) in which members were clinically diagnosed with VHL presenting without pheochromocytoma (VHL type 1), however, no further phenotypic information about specific patients was provided. This mutation was recorded as c.764T>C in the paper, due to the use of an older VHL reference transcript. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood for analysis. Polymorphisms in the VHL gene were detected by southern blotting, and were further investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. Partial and total deletions of the VHL gene were investigated by southern blot.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

These mutations generally lead to loss-of-function and mutations in the UHC domain of BAP1 have been shown to lead to structural instability and β-amyloid aggregation in models. Germline mutations are associated with an increased risk of tumorgenesis and can lead to the development of "atypical Spitz tumours (ASTs), cutaneous melanoma (CM), epithelioid malignant mesothelioma (MM) and clear cell RCC".

PIK3CA mutations were found in 16% (189/1170) of cased via pyrosequencing of FFPE samples, of these 58% (109/189) had mutations in exon 10, 39% (73/189) had mutations in exon 21, and 3.7% (7/189) had mutations in both exons. Study found that exon 10 + exon 21 mutants were associated with shorter cancer specific survival and overall survival when compared to WT PIK3CA (P = 0.031, P = 0.0008). These mutants were also associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality and overall mortality (multivariate hazard ratio (HR) = 3.51, multivariate HR 2.68). In contrast, mutations on either exon 10 or exon 21 alone were not statistically significant in terms of overall survival. Note that exons 10 and 21 are listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common at the time of its publication to exclude non-coding exon 1. Authors note that they had limited data on cancer treatment data, but assume that treatment regimens did not differ substantially based on PIK3CA mutation status given that patients were diagnosed prior to clinical availability of PIK3CA genotype data. They further note that treatment decisions were typically based on cancer stage, for which their analyses adjusted.	22357840	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, Clin.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

RRM1	6240	UNDEREXPRESSION	Pancreatic Cancer	1793		Gemcitabine		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this study, human pancreatic carcinoma cell line MiaPaCa2, which is a gemcitabine-sensitive cell line, was used for the establishment of chemoresistant cells MiaPaCa2-RG. Analysis for identifying genetic alterations relating to gemcitabine resistance revealed that RRM1 was the most upregulated gene with a 4.5 fold expression. RRM1-speciﬁc RNAi transfection significantly reduced the gemcitabine chemoresistance of MiaPaCa2-RG to the same level as that of gemcitabine sensitive MiaPaCa2. Moreover, gemcitabine response of MiaPaCa2 also became more sensitive.  Next, patients with pancreatic cancer were recruited and 18 tissue samples were taken. The patients with a low RRM1 expression had a significantly better outcome after gemcitabine treatment than those patients with high RRM1 expression (P=0.016).	17131328	PubMed		Nakahira et al., 2007, Int.

These tumors were studied for a relationship between RRM1 expression and chemotherapy regimens, gemcitabine, docetaxel and carboplatin, and vinorelbine and carboplatin. In the patients receiving gemcitabine treatment, the progression-free survival of RRM1-negative patients was significantly higher than that of RRM1-positive patients (8.8 months vs. 7.6 months, P = 0.01). The patients that were positive for RRM1 expression, had a better response to docetaxel or vinorelbine treatment than gemcitabine (P=0.047 and P=0.047). However, there were no differences of response to docetaxel and vinorelbine in regards to RRM1 expression.	24647522	PubMed		Dong et al., 2014, PLoS ONE		4	accepted	5530	1257	5051	11	4116039	4160106			ENST00000300738.5					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:50 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/5530	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1257	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/5051

In 43 of those pairs, the expression level of ARID1A was significantly lower in the cancerous tissue than in the normal tissue (P=0.0029). This was then again tested using Western Blotting. Consistent with the real-time PCR results, there was a lower expression of ARID1A in 13 of the tumor tissue samples compared to the normal tissue samples (P=0.0015). In an immunohistochemical analysis of 224 tissue blocks, 115 of those had a decreased ARID1A expression. The data conveyed that lower ARID1A expression was correlated with depth of tumor infiltration (P=0.001). Lastly, cell proliferation in regards to ARID1A expression was tested in cell lines. The cells with silenced expression of ARID1A had a much greater growth than those with greater expression of the protein.	22808142	PubMed		Wang et al., 2012, PLoS ONE		4	accepted	5675	2108	6559	1	27022524	27108595			ENST00000324856.7					75	GRCh37		N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:58 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/5675	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2108	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/6559

These samples were then divided according to ARID1A expression after immunohistochemical staining. Of the 290 patients, 213 had a low ARID1A expression and 77 patients had a high expression. Low ARID1A expression was associated with higher nuclear grade (P<0.001), advanced pTNM stage (P=0.013), shorter cancer-specific survival (p=0.001) and progression-free survival (P<0.001). After a multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazards, it was found that ARID1A expression levels are an independent predictor of progression-free survival in patients with CCRCC, although no significant correlation was found between the expression levels and cancer-specific survival.	25628030	PubMed		Park et al., 2015, Hum.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

ARID1A	8289	UNDEREXPRESSION	Ovarian Clear Cell Carcinoma	0050934				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	In this study, tissue sampling began with 77 ovarian cancer patients. Following, 60 of those samples, the patients withe clear cell ovarian cancer, were analyzed for ARID1A expression using immunohistochemistry.  Of those 60, 9 patients had a loss of ARID1A expression. Also, 17 high-grade serous adenocarcinomas were also analyzed and none of them showed a loss of ARID1A expression. The loss was more frequent in clear cell ovarian carcinoma than in the high-grade serous adenocarcinoma. Results showed that a low ARID1A expression was significantly related to advanced FIGO stages and high CAI25 levels (P=0.02). Those patients with a low expression experienced shorter progression free survival than those with no loss of expression (P<0.01). In a multivariate analysis it was found that a loss of ARID1A expression was significant for shorter disease free survival (P=0.03) and shorter overall survival for patients whose ovarian clear cell carcinoma was treated with platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.015). Lastly, tumors with low expression were significantly more likely to be resistant to primary adjuvant chemotherapy than tumors with a higher expression (P=0.04).	22101352	PubMed		Katagiri et al., 2012, Mod.

ACMG evidence codes: 'PP1' because of cosegregation with disease in multiple affected family members in a gene known to cause the disease, 'PP4' because the patient's phenotype and family history are highly specific for a disease with a single genetic etiology.	25715769	PubMed		Heo et al., 2016, Cancer Res Treat		3	accepted	5805	1956	58	3	10183739	10183739	G	A	ENST00000256474.2					75	GRCh37	The VHL gene has a low rate of benign missense variation and is known to be definitively associated with VHL disease. The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.

Patients were pretreated with at least one chemotherapy regimen, but no tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In the subgroup of 156 patients with exon 19 deletions as their sole EGFR mutation, 83 and 78 were treated with erlotinib and gefitinib, respectively.

The study was unable to demonstrate statistical noninferiority via the planned end point; however, the lack of statistically significant differences between erlotinib and gefitinib responses, and the milder adverse effects experienced by gefitinib treated patients, led the authors to conclude that gefitinib is a feasible alternative to erlotinib in treating patients with ex19del EGFR positive, advanced lung adenocarcinoma.	27022112	PubMed		Urata et al., 2016, J.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood.

It assessed the relationship between PIK3CA mutation status in primary tumors and response to bevacizumab-containing first line chemotherapy, as measured by PFS. Of the 97 patients, 83 had wildtype PIK3CA and 14 had mutations in PIK3CA on either exon 9 or 20 (exon 9 mutations: E542K, E545K, E545G, E545D, Q546K, D549N.

Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. The NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer contain recommendations that the targeted therapies cetuximab and panitumumab should only be used in the context of wild type KRAS. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a single cohort of colorectal patients with G12D mutations. Overall, the interpretation for KRAS mutations in most clinical scenarios is still undecided.

Of 964 patients, 803 patients had wildtype PIK3CA (aspirin use: 337/803, no aspirin use: 466/803)  and 161 had mutated PIK3CA (aspirin use: 66/161, no aspirin use: 95/161). This study found that—among patients with mutated PIK3CA cancer— regular use of aspirin following diagnosis was correlated with superior colorectal cancer specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61; P<0.001) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = 0.01). Conversely, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not significantly associated with colorectal cancer–specific survival or overall survival. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA tumors, 23 of 90 patients who did not use aspirin after diagnosis (26%) died within 5 years after diagnosis, whereas only 2 of 62 regular users of aspirin after diagnosis (3%) died within 5 years after diagnosis (P<0.001). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA tumors, the 5-year cumulative colorectal cancer–specific mortality was the same (15%) for users and nonusers of aspirin after diagnosis (P = 0.92). The authors conclude that PIK3CA mutation may predict response to aspirin therapy in patients with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer.	23094721	PubMed		Liao et al., 2012, N. Engl. J.

This line showed a significant reduction in colony formation (P = 0.0004) and MTT assay, which tests for NADH activity (P < 0.001), with imatinib vs vehicle treatment. There was no significant difference in a lung cancer cell line without a known driver (H2126) nor in an immortalized bronchial epithelial line (Beas-2B) with either drug treatment in colony forming and MTT assays. Additionally, reduction in cell viability upon kinase inhibitor treatment was rescued with tetracycline-induced overexpression of resistant ABL1-T315I (P < 0.001) confirming the genetic dependency of this cell line on ABL1. Moreover, siRNA facilitated depletion of ABL1 expression resulted in significantly increased cytotoxicity (P < 0.004) with no significant change in H2126 or Beas-2B lines for 2/3 siRNAs supporting ABL1 as the primary drug target. Significant tumor reduction was observed in murine NSCLC xenografts of the H1915 cell line treated with imatinib compared to vehicle treatment (P = 0.0016). No change in tumor growth was observed in xenografts of the H650 cell line containing a wildtype ABL1 locus. In both in vitro and in vivo experiments, doxycycline-inducible expression of drug-resistant ABL1-T315I rescued imatinib-mediated inhibitory effects supporting the specificity of drug responses.	26758680	PubMed		Testoni et al., 2016, EMBO Mol Med		5	accepted	6376	1656	4	9	133748333	133748333	C	T	ENST00000372348.2					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:28 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6376	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1656	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4

Patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 11 mutations (n=19) experienced higher rates of clinical benefit (defined as complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting >16 weeks) than patients whose GISTs harbored KIT exon 9 mutations.  15/19 patients with exon 11 mutant GISTs experienced clinical benefit (including 2 PRs). KIT exon 11 mutant GISTs treated with regorafenib monotherapy were associated with improved median progression free survival (13.4 months vs. 5.7 and 1.6 months, P<0.0001), as compared to patients with KIT exon 9 mutation (n=2) and patients with KIT wildtype, non-succinate dehydrogenase-deficient tumors (n=2).	27371698	PubMed		Ben-Ami et al., 2016, Ann.

FGFR3	2261	FGFR3-TACC3	Transitional Cell Carcinoma	2671		Infigratinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this one-arm study, 67 patients with metastastic urothelial carcinoma and diverse FGFR3 alterations were treated with pan-FGFR Inhibitor BGJ398. The majority of patients (70.1%) had received two or more prior antineoplastic therapies. An overall response rate of 25.4% was observed and an additional 38.8% of patients had disease stabilization. No clear differences between type of FGFR3 aberration and response could be seen. The authors conclude that BGJ398 appears to have moderate anticancer activity in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma, that response rates and disease control rate exceed outcomes with most agents in this setting, and that enriching for patients with activating FGFR3 mutations together with the high specificity of BGJ398 for FGFR3 likely explains this improved response.	29848605	PubMed		Pal et al., 2018, Cancer Discov		3	accepted	6409	830	23	4	1795039	1808661			ENST00000340107.4	4	1741429	1746898	ENST00000313288.4	75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:16 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6409	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/830	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/23

The patient was diagnosed with IFS at 6 months of age. At 16 months the patient enrolled in a pediatric Phase 1 trial of LOXO‐101 (Larotrectinib, ARRY-470), an experimental, highly selective inhibitor of TRK. The patient experienced a rapid, radiographic response, demonstrating the potential for LOXO‐101 to provide benefit for IFS harboring NTRK gene fusions.	27093299	PubMed		Nagasubramanian et al., 2016, Pediatr Blood Cancer		2	accepted	6473	801	3985	12	11802788	12022903			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984	88418230	ENST00000394480.2	75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6473	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/801	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3985

None had significant exposure to radiation. 5 / 27 PTCs (18.5%) had NTRK3-ETV6 fusion oncogenes. The authors compare NTRK3-ETV6 (and include 2 other NTRK fusion samples) to PTCs with BRAF(V) (600E) and find they are associated with large size (mean, 2.2 cm vs 1.5 cm, respectively; P = .05), solid and diffuse variants (11 of 13 vs 0 of 13 tumors, respectively; P < .001), and lymphovascular invasion (12 of 13 vs 6 of 13 tumors, respectively; P = .02); The authors conclude that NTRK fusion oncogene PTC presents with more extensive disease and aggressive pathology than BRAF(V) (600E) PTC in the pediatric population.	26784937	PubMed		Prasad et al., 2016, Cancer		3	accepted	6474	801	3985	12	11802788	12022903			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984	88418230	ENST00000394480.2	75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6474	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/801	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3985

Over the next years, she experienced recurrence, multiple rounds of chemotherapy and metastasis -- until her case was presented at a virtual multidisciplinary tumor board organized by the Global Cancer Institute which recommended testing for ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This fusion was confirmed by RNA-seq, targeted DNA and WGS sequencing as well as immunohistochemistry staining with a TRK antibody. The patient was treated with LOXO-101 (larotrectinib) in a single patient use protocol. Within two months, she experienced near complete resolution of a 10.4 × 8.5 cm fungating chest mass with multiple satellite lesions (See Figure 2). The authors note that TERT promoter mutation and a reciprocal inversion including CDKN2A were also identified, but given what is known about LOXO-101 and ETV6-NTRK3, they  infer ETV6-NTRK3 fusion as the primary mitogenic driver in this patient.	29623306	PubMed		Shukla et al., 2017, JCO Precis Oncol		3	accepted	6475	801	3985	12	11802788	12022903			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984	88418230	ENST00000394480.2	75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/6475	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/801	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3985

The E70K missense mutation, located in the Beta-domain of VHL, is rare in open-source genome databases (0.00001489 allele frequency in ExAC, 4.365e-6 allele frequency in gnomAD) and was identified in several individuals with VHL disease symptoms (see evidence statements). Thus, this variant could be assigned ACMG code 'PP2' - Missense mutation in a gene with a low rate of benign missense variation where missense variants are a common mechanism of disease. Although this variant is registered once in ExAC and gnomAD, 'PM2' could be applied (Absent from controls in ESP, 1000 Genomes or ExAC) because VHL manifestations sometimes emerge later in adulthood. Thus, the allele may have been detected in a proband who was not yet affected by symptoms.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.

It is unclear whether she had germline testing. However, the patient met clinical criteria for VHL (Losner et al., 2003). Interestingly, the HB from this patient was noted to have LOH of chromosome 3p.

In YFP-luciferase PDX mice from a 16-year-old with Ph-like B-ALL, flow cytometry indicated the absence of leukemic cells in the bone marrow (p<.0001), peripheral blood (p=.0018), and spleen (p=.0001) after 6 weeks of Larotrectinib (n=10) compared to vehicle treated mice (n=10). Treated mice also had lower splenic weight (p<.001) and the absence of leukemia burden in the bone marrow and central nervous system as determined by histopathology. In 2 mice, leukemic burden increased while Larotrectinib was paused from weeks 6-25. Upon the reintroduction of treatment for 4 weeks, leukemic burden was lowered. Conditional knock-in Etv6-NTRK CD19-Cre cells isolated from bone marrow and cultured ex vivo were highly sensitive to serial dilutions of Larotrectinib. After 48 hours of Larotrectinib exposure, Ba/F3 cells stably expressing ETV6-NTRK3 demonstrated a response with an IC50 of 17.0nM (viability measured by CellTiter blue). Finally, Larotrectinib was 1000x more potent against 3 human cancer cell lines with an NTRK fusion versus the 76 with other alterations.

These hotspots, termed C228T and C250T are observed in many cancer types and have a particularly high prevalence in glioblastoma (83%), melanoma (71%), bladder cancer (66%) and hepatocelluar carcinoma (HCC) (47%). The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors. The presence of these mutations has also been shown to be predictive of malignant/premalignant nodules in HCC and meningiomas.

The patient had a complex karyotype and microarray revealed a 9p duplication involving JAK2 and deletions of IKZF1, PAX5, and CDKN2A. RNA studies demonstrated a Ph-like ALL expression signature but did not identify the underlying kinase fusion. Research level RNA sequencing identified a GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion which was confirmed by other methods and patient cells were introduced to patient-derived xenograft models that demonstrated a response to ruxolitinib. Therefore, 40mg/m2 ruxolitinib was added to the patient’s multiagent chemotherapy regiment. The treatment was well tolerated and the patient demonstrated significant clinical response by the end of consolidation, though MRD ≥ 0.01% was detected by flow cytometry. The patient received CART therapy and achieved MRD negative remission, then underwent HSCT, and remained in remission with full donor chimerism at 2-months post-HSCT.	29773603	PubMed		Ding et al., 2018, Haematologica		3	accepted	7007	3214	28														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:24:06 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7007	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3214	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/28

This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, R248 mutations have been shown to confer worse overall survival. The R248Q mutation has also shown an increased invasive behavior in cell lines. This is specific to the 248Q variant.

Tumor samples were obtained at the time of surgery and genotyped for PIK3CA mutations in exons 10 and 21 (listed as exons 9 and 20 in the source, as it was common to exclude non-coding exon 1). PIK3CA mutations were identified in 19 cases (12 in exon 10 and 7 in exon 21). PIK3CA mutations were associated with a 3-fold increase in risk of recurrence of rectal tumors (5-year risk: 27.8% vs 9.4%, p = 0.008). Furthermore, patients with PIK3CA mutations experienced a shorter time to recurrence compared to those with WT PIK3CA (median: 7.9 vs 19.6 months, p = 0.07). Patients with concomitant PIK3CA and KRAS mutations had a similar local reoccurrence rate to patients with PIK3CA mutations only. In multivariate analysis, PIK3A mutation was an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (HR: 3.4, P =0.017).	19903786	PubMed		He et al., 2009, Clin.

Karyotype showed an abnormal clone characterized by the t(3;9)(p13;q34.1). This translocation results in an abnormal fusion between the FOXP1 gene in 3p13 and the ABL1 in 9q34.1. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion is known to be associated with Ph-like B-ALL subtype of B-ALL.  The patient was treated with Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) high-risk 4-drug induction chemotherapy with prednisone, daunorubicin, vincristine, and pegasparaginase and had 0.013% MRD at the end of indusciton. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor dasatinib was added to the consolidationchemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, peg-asparaginase, mercaptopurine, and vincristine. End-of-consolidation bone marrow tested negative for MRD.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

Colorectal cancer patients with the PIK3CA E545K variant, and possibly other variants in the E545 region, may indicate poor prognosis relative to patients with other PIK3CA variants or wild-type PIK3CA. The literature also suggests that E545/E542 variants may confer resistance to EGFR inhibitors (e.g., cetuximab). An FDA approved treatment regimen including a targeted PIK3CA inhibitor is available for specific subtypes of breast cancer.

IKZF1	10320	IKZF1 deletion and mutation	Childhood B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	0080146				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study reports on two pediatric cohorts with B-ALL. In the first cohort of 221 high risk, BCR-ABL1-negative pediatric patients, 55.2% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 73.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 74.6% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event (hematologic relapse, any relapse, a second malignant condition or death) as compared to 14%, 25.2%, and 27.1%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. In a less selected cohort of 258 patients with both standard and high risk disease, with common aneuploidies including BCR-ABL1, 46.3% of IKZF1 positive patients had a hematologic relapse, 48.4% of IKZF1 positive patients had any relapse, and 60.5% of IKZF1 positive patients had an event as compared to 22.5%, 25.6%, and 27.6%, respectively, without an IKZF1 alteration. IKZF1 alteration is defined as a deletion or mutation in the gene. Gene expression profiles were found to be similar to BCR-ABL1 positive B-ALL, even when the BCR-ABL1 translocation was not present. The study concludes that IKZF1 alterations are associated with a very poor outcome in B-ALL.	19129520	PubMed		Mullighan et al., 2009, N. Engl. J.

This mutant is also more responsive to treatment with doxorubicin than its wild-type counterparts. While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, it has been suggested that the R273 mutants have been correlated with worse overall survival in breast cancer patients when compared to wild-type.

STAG2	10735	MUTATION	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	Poor Outcome	In a retrospective cohort study of 389 uniformly treated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, 23 patients harbored mutations in genes of the cohesin complex including 5 who harbored mutations in STAG2. Mutation in the cohesin complex was not associated with worse overall survival (OS) or relapse free survival (RFS) compared to wildtype patients. The presence of STAG2 mutations had no influence on OS or RFS compared to wildtype (OS HR: 1.53, p = 0.4; RFS HR: 1.26, P = 0.7), though the authors note that the analysis was limited by the small number of patients. Authors speculate that co-occurring mutations in NPM1 may mask prognostic effects of STAG2 mutations.	24335498	PubMed		Thol et al., 2014, Blood	NCT00209833	2	accepted	7451	669	8553	X	123176418	123217308			ENST00000218089.9					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:22:43 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7451	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/669	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/8553

The S628N mutation was not present in the blood, which confirmed that it was a somatic mutation. After 3 months of imatinib treatment (300 mg/d for first three weeks, then 400 mg/d), the patient exhibited disease progression and increased tumor size, and after an additional three months of imatinib treatment (400 mg/d), the patient developed multiple supratentorial brain metastases in addition to increased lung metastases and died 5 days later. The authors reported preclinical data which indicated variant sensitivity to imatinib. although this outcome did not coroberate the preclinical result, the authors still concluded the variant may be sensitive.	25317746	PubMed		Vita et al., 2014, JAMA Dermatol		3	accepted	7463	1659	29	4	55594180	55594180	G	A							GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:14 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7463	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/1659	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/29

ROS1	6098	GOPC-ROS1	Glioblastoma Multiforme	3068		Lorlatinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	Ectopic expression of GOPC–ROS1 in Ba/F3 cells induced cytokine-independent growth whereas overexpression of ROS1 alone did not. Using a series of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, lorlatinib was the most effective inhibitor of cytokine-independent growth. The glioblastoma cell line U118MG was shown to have the GOPC–ROS1 fusion. Lorlatinib and other TKIs were unable to inhibit growth of U118MG in standard growth assays (2D). However, lorlatinib did induce cell death in both ultra-low attachment dishes and spheroid assays, and significantly increased overall survival in an orthotopic intracranial xenograft model using this cell line (N=4) compared to mice on vehicle alone (N=4, p<0.001, ANOVA). Authors postulated that cell adhesion permitted sufficient to bypass survival signaling.	30171048	PubMed		Davare et al., 2018, Clin.

A 59-year-old metastatic PDAC patient harbored an in-frame fusion of exon 3 of ATP1B1 with exon 2 of NRG1 and no other observed clinically relevant small mutations. Compared to this PDAC cohort, significant overexpression of NRG1 (exons 2-7) was observed in the tumor. Of note, the EGF-like domain of NRG1 (exons 6 & 7), which is required for HER-family kinase activation, is preserved in the fusion. Treatment with afatinib resulted in significant clinical response as measured by imaging, as well as a drastic reduction in CA19-9 levels. Disease progression was noted 5.5 months after treatment initiation.	31068372	PubMed		Jones et al., 2019, Clin.

In a 54-year-old with metastatic PDAC, a complex rearrangement involving the insertion of exons 6 and 7 of NRG1 between exons 15 and 16 of APP was found. This in-frame fusion resulted in the preservation and increased expression of the EGF-like domain of NRG1, which is required for HER-family kinase activation.

Cells were treated with and without DNA damaging agent and p53 inducing agent Daunorubicin and western blot used to assess p21 induction. p21 was induced in +/+ and +/-, but not -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells. Daunorubicin treatment caused less cell death in +/- than in +/+ cells, but induced significantly less death in -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/-, where these three conditions were not statistically different. A similar result was seen with p53 activating agent Nutlin-3a, where p53-/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- cells grouped together with equivalent resistance to the agent in comparison to +/+ and +/- cells. The grouping in results of  -/-, R248Q/+, and R248Q/- suggest that R248Q inactivates the wt p53 copy, which does not occur in the +/- condition.	31395785	PubMed		Boettcher et al., 2019, Science		4	accepted	7525	117	45	17	7577538	7577538	C	T	ENST00000269305.4					75	GRCh37	While loss-of-function events in TP53 are very common in cancer, the R248 variants seem not only to result in loss of tumor-suppression, but also act as a gain-of-function mutation that can promote tumorigenesis in mouse models.

While the prognostic impact of individual TP53 mutations is influenced by the cohort being studied, R248 mutations have been shown to confer worse overall survival.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy.  These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC.  The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases.  In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely.  Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy.  Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.

Cell proliferation assays showed that SNX2-ABL1 transfected cells had over 20% and 50% of cell survival after 24-hr incubation with imatinib (2µM) and dasatinib (10nM). SNX2-ABL1 transfected cells continued to proliferate again 48 hr after treatment with dasatinib (10nM). This data was further supported by apoptosis (annexin V-propidium iodide) studies. In addition, newer tyrosine kinase inhibitors including nilotinib (500nM), bafetinib (500nM), rebastinib (500nM), and ponatinib (100nM), were examined and SNX2-ABL1 cells showed a better response, but still some resistance to these compounds. Further examination of downstream phosphorylation of SNX2-ABL1 cells showed only partial inhibition with imatinib and dasatinib.	24367893	PubMed		Tomita et al., 2014, Leuk.

FLT3	2322	MUTATION	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib		Predictive	Supports	B	Sensitivity/Response	In this phase 3 trial (ADMIRAL), 371 patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML (required to have FLT3 ITD or TKD D835 or I836 mutations) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either gilteritinib (n=247, at a dose of 120 mg per day) or salvage chemotherapy (n=124). Median overall survival in the gilteritinib group was significantly longer than in the chemotherapy group (9.3 months vs. 5.6 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.83; P<0.001). Median event-free survival was 2.8 months in the gilteritinib group and 0.7 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for treatment failure or death, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.09). The complete remission rate with full or partial hematologic recovery was 34.0% in the gilteritinib group and 15.3% in the chemotherapy group (risk difference, 18.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 9.8 to 27.4); the percentages with complete remission were 21.1% and 10.5%, respectively (risk difference, 10.6 percentage points; 95% CI, 2.8 to 18.4). Notably, gilteritinib treatment resulted in similar median overall survival (9.3 months vs. 8.0 months) and percentage of complete remission (20.5% vs. 19.0%) in patients with ITD mutations and patients with TKD mutations. The authors concluded gilteritinib therapy in relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML patients resulted longer survival and improved response versus salvage chemotherapy.	31665578	PubMed		Perl et al., 2019, N.

Karyotype analysis showed a t(5;9)(q22;q34), resulting in a SNX2-ABL1 fusion. The patient was treated based on the ALL-BFM95 regimen; although he received remission, he relapsed during maintenance, 15 months after the initial diagnosis.  He could not achieve the second remission using chemotherapy, but was treated at this time with imatinib (dose of 240 mg/m2 /d once daily); this allowed to achieve disease control and proceed with an umbilical cord blood transplant. However, at 6 months from transplantation, the patient developed bone marrow relapse again. He never achieved a remission after the second relapse (despite salvage chemotherapies and therapy with both imatinib and dasatinib). The patient died of progressive disease.	24215620	PubMed		Masuzawa et al., 2014, Eur. J.

CTNNB1	1499	exon 3 mutation	Desmoid Tumor	0080366				Prognostic	Does Not Support	B	N/A	This study illustrates the prevalence of CTNNB1 mutations in sporadic desmoid tumors, and examines whether the presence of CTNNB1 mutations correlates with the disease outcome. CTNNB1 mutations (including specific exon 3 mutations T41A, S45F, S45P, and S45C) were found in 106 out of 145 desmoid tumor specimens, and in 86 out of 115 specimens from patients who had undergone complete surgical resection. At a median follow-up of 31 months, the 5-year recurrence free survival rate of patients with the beta-catenin mutated tumors was worse than that of the patients with wild-type tumors (58% vs 74%), however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.285). Thus, the study shows that there is no statistically significant correlation between the CTNNB1 mutation and the recurrence risk of sporadic desmoid tumors, even though specific exon 3 CTNNB1 mutations are commonly identified in these tumors.	23960186	PubMed		Mullen et al., 2013, Oncologist		4	accepted	7784	2892	1290														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:12 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7784	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2892	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1290

A biopsy was taken for whole genome and transcriptome analysis and the patient was started on systemic therapy. After showing resistance to the systemic therapy treatment with 5-FU and leucovorin was initiated based on the discovery of a somatic exon 11-19 in frame deletion in DPYD, which was hypothesized to increase sensitivity to 5-FU in the tumour. A dramatic clinical and radiographic response was sustained for 17 weeks, but following a 3 week treatment break a new nodule appeared. This recurrence showed resistance to re-initiation of treatment with capecitabine (oral 5-FU), and analysis of an additional biopsy provided no evidence as to the mechanism of resistance.	31871216	PubMed		Majounie et al., 2019, Cold Spring Harb Mol Case Stud		4	accepted	7787	2893	1526	1	97700408	98039526			ENST00000370192.3					75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:16 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7787	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2893	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/1526

Of the 127 patients enrolled, 17 achieved complete response and 74 achieved partial response. Overall response rate by independent radiology review was 71.7% (95% CI 63-79.3%) Time to response was rapid (median 1.9 months) and durable (Duration of response median 19.7 months). Median progression free survival was 15.9 months. Crizotinib was clinically beneficial regardless of demographics and prior therapy. Based on these results, Crizotinib was approved for the treatment of ROS1 positive NSCLC in 2017 in Japan, Taiwan, China, and Korea.	29596029	PubMed		Wu et al., 2018, J. Clin. Oncol.

Approximately 2% of NSCLC patients harbor a ROS1 gene fusion. Several fusion partners have been described with a constant ROS1-breakpoint, maintaining the kinase domain (Solomon B, 2015). Following case-studies and retrospective analyses, an expansion cohort of a phase-1 study showed clinical benefit of crizotinib in ROS1 rearranged NSCLC. The benefit was independent of the type of ROS1-rearrangement (Shaw et. al.,2014).

CHEK2	11200	R474C c.1420C>T	Cancer	162				Predisposing	N/A	C	N/A	Siblings (brother and sister) each were diagnosed with multiple primary lung cancer at the age of 60, along with various other cancers in their lifetimes. Homozygosity mapping revealed their parents (who also had cancer) had a consanguineous union. Each sibling was homozygous for CHEK2 R474C. The brother also had a son who died of neuroblastoma at 22 months of age. Amino acid R474 is highly conserved (98%) and forms a salt bridge in both the inactive and active CHEK2 homodimer. Modeling reveals R474C likely negatively affects the saltbridge and destabilizes the protein. Calcium phosphate DNA precipitation to overexpress CHEK2 WT or R474C in NIH3T3 cells revealed limited expression of R474C and limited activation through phosphorylation after UV exposure compared to the WT CHEK2 controls.

PDGFRA	5156	OVEREXPRESSION	Rhabdomyosarcoma	3247		Sunitinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	A high-throughput screen of 637 cancer cell lines revealed 2 to be sensitive to the multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. The most highly sensitive line was A-204, a rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. A-204 was then compared to a panel of 6 other rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines and was the only one of the 7 with detectable PDGFRA protein (Western) and to demonstrate sensitivity to sunitinib. In A-204, no PDGFRA gene amplification was detected by FISH, but qPCR revealed a an increased PDGFRA mRNA expression. Reduction of PDFGRA expression by shRNA decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment. Additionally, targeting the PDGFRA ligand, PDGFC, with shRNA or antibody decreased cell number similarly to sunitinib treatment.	19366796	PubMed		McDermott et al., 2009, Cancer Res.		3	accepted	7988	2944	38														N/A	2021-03-31 18:22:46 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7988	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2944	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/38
PDGFRA	5156	BCR-PDGFRA	B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia	0080638		Imatinib		Predictive	Supports	C	Sensitivity/Response	A 47-year-old man was diagnosed with pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. FISH and nested PCR revealed the patient had a t(4;22)(q12;11) translocation that created an in-frame BCR-PDGFRA fusion. The constitutively activating coiled-coil domain and serine/threonine kinase encoded by BCR exon 1 fused with exon 13 of PDGFRA, which retained both tyrosine kinase domains. During initial therapy, intensification, and consolidation, hyperleukocytosis persisted. Based on the presence of the BCR-PDGFRA fusion, single agent imatinib (Glivec) was administered. A complete hematological response was observed within 6 weeks as the presence of t(4;22) in the bone marrow went from a 70% down to 15%. However, the patient had a relapse in the central nervous system. Continued treatment with imatinib along with intrathecal chemotherapy achieved a meningeal remission after 2 weeks. According to the authors, this patient’s response implicates PDGFRA as a clinically actionable imatinib target.	12944919	PubMed		Trempat et al., 2003, Oncogene		3	accepted	7990	2971	38														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:56 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7990	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2971	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/38

Post resection, multiple nodular metastases were found in both lungs and the disease progressed following treatments with cytotoxic agents and microwave ablation. Overexpression of PDGFRB was detected by IHC and a COL1A1-PDGFB fusion was detected by RT-PCR. Increased PDGFRB is activated by the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion product, which promotes the overactivation of downstream PDGFRB signaling pathways. Imatinib treatment failed as stable disease was followed by disease spread and progression. The patient was then treated with a daily oral dose of sunitinib (a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor) for 4 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. After 2 months on sunitinib, the patient experienced overall shrinkage of the body’s tumor mass (reduction of tumor in arm and partial response in lung and pancreas metastases). Sunitinib resulted in 9 months of progression free survival and improved quality of life.

An initial analysis detected the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion and a NRASGly12Asp mutation. Initial therapies included chemotherapy and CAR-T infusion. Relapse 6 weeks after initial complete response to these therapies found a large increase in fusion transcripts and NTRK3 rearrangements were detectable by FISH in 50/50 blast nuclei whereas NRAS mutations were no longer detectable.  The patient was treated with oral monotherapy larotrectinib (100mg twice per day).  After 4 days on treatment peripheral blood blasts became undetectable; after 6 days on treatment lymphadenopathy and leukemia cutis resolved and a biopsy revealed an ablated bone marrow with only a few scattered blasts.  The patient experienced clinical benefit with no apparent side effects during 42 days of larotrectinib treatment, however, patient eventually succumbed to multifocal angioinvasive aspergillosis because of insufficient recovery of normal hematopoiesis. Later sequencing of the NTRK3 kinase domain did not detect any larotrectinib resistance mutations (p.G623R, p.G696A).	31905241	PubMed		Nardi et al., 2020, Blood Adv		3	accepted	7993	801	3985	12	11802788	12022903			ENST00000396373.4	15	88483984	88418230	ENST00000394480.2	75	GRCh37		Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/7993	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/801	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3985

Overall, this data suggests p-loop mutations that arise during late-chronic phase support resistance to imatinib.	12623848	PubMed		Branford et al., 2003, Blood		2	accepted	8094	2375	4														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:06 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8094	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/2375	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/4

Additionally, immunoblots showed gliteritinib reduced phosphorylation of FLT3 and downstream targets in Ba/F3 D835Y cells in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, in nude mice xenografted with Ba/F3 cells expressing D835Y, gilteritinib showed antitumor efficacy at 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg, and induced tumor regression at 30 mg/k. Computational modelling demonstrated that gilteritinib interacts with activated FLT3 at the ATP-binding site, which is distant from the D835 containing activation loop. This inhibitory mechanism allows for kinase inhibition to occur in the face of D835 mutation.	28516360	PubMed		Mori et al., 2017, Invest New Drugs		4	accepted	8106	3011	24														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:13 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8106	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3011	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/24

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.

PML	5371	PML-RARA A216V	Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia	0060318		Arsenic Trioxide		Predictive	Supports	B	Resistance	Five point mutations were identified in the PML B2 domain of PML-RARA transcripts in 9 patients diagnosed with APL and resistant to arsenic. Of these five, A216V, S214L, and A216T mutations conveyed resistance to arsenic treatment in experimental models. DNA from these 9 patients was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and constructed into flag-tagged pCag expression vectors. Immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that after the addition of arsenic, the A216V, S214L, and A216T mutants experienced no change in expression or degradation when compared to wild type cells, indicating that these mutants were not inhibited by arsenic and demonstrate resistance. Immunofluorescence to examine cellular localization was also performed and conveyed similar results. Arsenic treatment did not alter the nuclear localization pattern of mutants with A216V, S214L, or A216T, but had an effect on the localization of other mutants as well as wild type cells.	26537301	PubMed		Liu et al., 2016, Blood		4	accepted	8177	462	39	15	74315213	74315213	C	T	ENST00000268058.3					75	GRCh37	A216V in the B2 domain of PML is one of the variants found in a patient with ATRA-resistant APL.

MYOD1	4654	L122R	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260				Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	This study evaluated forty-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (17 cases of alveolar RMS, 10 of embryonal RMS, 21 of spindle cell and sclerosing RMS, and a single case of a pleomorphic RMS) for MYOD1 (L122R), PIK3CA (H1047), and PIK3CA (E542/E545) variants. All 10 cases that were positive for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant were either the spindle cell (3/12) or the sclerosing (7/9) subtypes of RMS, while all 10 cases of the embryonal subtype of RMS were negative for the MYOD1 (L122R) variant. The study suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is specific for spindle cell and sclerosing subtype of RMS (where it was detected in 10/21 cases or 48%). The study also confirmed the positive relationship between the spindle cell and the sclerosing subtypes of RMS, which both can have the same molecular abnormality (MYOD1 L122R variant) and are now considered to be the same subtype. Finally, the study confirmed the negative correlation between the aforementioned subtypes with the embryonal subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.	27562493	PubMed		Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

None of the embryonal RMS cases was positive for the MYOD1 L122R variant. All cases were treated with surgical resection and either adjuvant chemotherapy, adjuvant radiotherapy, or both. On patient follow-up, the alive-with-disease ratio was higher in the adult than in the pediatric population. Furthermore, the patients positive for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-positive states on follow-up, while the patients negative for MYOD1 mutation showed a higher number of disease-free states on follow-up. This suggests that the MYOD1 L122R variant is associated with a more aggressive clinical course, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (P=0.34).	27562493	PubMed		Rekhi et al., 2016, Mod.

MYOD1	4654	L122R	Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma	3260				Prognostic	Supports	B	Poor Outcome	This study examined 17 cases of spindle cell/sclerosing rhabdomyosarcoma (SC/SRMS) for the presence of MYOD1 variants. 12 cases harbored a MYOD-1 mutation, of which 8 cases were homozygous for p.L122R, 3 were heterozygous for p.L122R, and 1 was heterozygous for a novel p.E118K variant. There was one case of predominantly spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma with the MYOD-1 mutation that also contained a PIK3CA mutation. The case with both MYOD-1 and PIK3CA mutations consisted histologically of lipoblasts within focally myxoid stroma, thus demonstrating that the PIK3CA mutation was a secondary aberration while MYOD-1 was the primary neomorphic mutation. On clinical follow-up, seven of the MYOD-1 variant cases experienced local recurrences and/or metastatic disease. In a median of a 13.5 month follow-up, there was 1 patient who passed away, 8 patients who were alive with the disease, and 3 patients who were alive without the disease; there was no correlation with the type of treatment that the patients had received. This supports aggressive clinical course for SC/SRMS positive for MYOD-1 variants, regardless of the presence of a concurrent PIK3CA mutation.	30604891	PubMed		Tsai et al., 2019, Histopathology		3	accepted	8313	3032	3777														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:23:41 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8313	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3032	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/3777

ALK	238	ALK FUSIONS	Lung Non-small Cell Carcinoma	3908		Alectinib		Predictive	Supports	A	Sensitivity/Response	A randomized phase 3 trial (J-ALEX) of 207 Japanese ALK-positive NSCLC patients compared the efficacy and safety of alectinib (300mg twice daily) and crizotinib (250mg twice daily) in the first-line setting. When used as a first line treatment the median progression-free survival of the alectinib group was unreached (95% CI 17.5–not estimated) versus 10.2 months (95% CI 8.3–13.9) in the crizotinib group (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.17–0·57). In the overall intent to treat population, Alectinib showed improved median PFS (HR 0.34; 99.7% CI 0.17-0.71; stratified log-rank p<0·0001) with an unreached PFS (95% CI 20.3-not estimated) compared to 10.2 months (95% CI 8.2-12.0) for crizotinib. The safety profile of alectinib was favorable relative to crizotinib with fewer dose interruptions (29% vs 74%) and fewer grade 3-4 adverse events (26% vs 52%).	28501140	PubMed		Hida et al., 2017, Lancet		5	accepted	8657	499	1	2	29415640	29446394			ENST00000389048.3					75	GRCh37	Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer.   In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response.   Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets.  ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC.     ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC.  Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

These mutations have been observed in up to 40%, 20%, and 21% respectively for each of these cancer types with mutations commonly occurring within the helical exon 9 and kinase domain of exon 20. In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability. In vivo, SW48 cells were injected into NOD/SCID mice. Treatment with regorafenib did not lead to a significant delay of tumor growth, although KRAS wt mice trended toward better response than KRAS G12C expressing mice. IHC analysis of mouse tissue revealed more pronounced changes in markers of proliferation (Ki67), angiogenesis (CD31), and apoptosis (TUNEL) in KRAS wt mice treated with regorafenib compared to KRAS G12C mice whose tumors did not display changes in these markers. Authors concluded that KRAS wildtype was not resistant to regorafenib compared to other common KRAS G12/G13 mutations.	26161928	PubMed		Camaj et al., 2015, Future Oncol		2	accepted	8840	3200	30														Somatic	2021-03-31 18:24:05 UTC	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/evidence_items/8840	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/variants/3200	https://civic.genome.wustl.edu/links/genes/30

FGFR3	2261	S249C	Thanatophoric Dysplasia, The Most Common Form Of Sporadic, Lethal Dwarfism					Functional	Supports	D	Gain of Function	Study focuses on acquiring quantitative measurement of the effect of cysteine mutations on membrane protein interactions; specifically the effect of 3 TDI mutations (Arg248Cys, Ser249Cys, and Tyr373Cys) on unliganded FGFR3 RTK dimer stability, using Forster Resonance Energy Transfer-based technique. Measurements were performed in plasma membrane vesicles from CHO cells. They report that the S249C mutation had a modest effect on dimer stability and structure, which is in contrast to the strong bond that they expected due to their covalent nature. Therefore, they conclude that this study does not support the 'simple view' that the TDI cysteine mutations cause pathologies by inducing constitutive FGFR3 dimerization.	25606676	PubMed		Del Piccolo et al., 2015, Biophys.

These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.

FLT3	2322	ITD	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Gilteritinib		Predictive	Supports	D	Sensitivity/Response	In vitro gilteritinib treatment of MV4-11 and MOLM-13 cells, which endogenously express FLT3-ITD, showed growth suppression based on CellTiter GLO cytotoxicity assays with IC50 values of 0.92 nM (95% CI: 0.23–3.6 nM) and 2.9 nM (95% CI: 1.4–5.8 nM), respectively. Phosphorylation of FLT3 and its downstream targets were rapidly inhibited in MV4-11 cells relative to control treatment (DMSO). In a mouse xenograft model using MV4-11 cells, increasing doses of gilteritinib further reduced tumor size and growth and inhibited phosphorylation of both FLT3 and STAT5 (N=6, p<0.05 at lowest dose). Gilteritinib inhibited growth in vitro of Ba/F3 cells expressing FLT3-ITD (IC50 1.8nM; 95% CI: 1.0-3.0 nM) and in vivo as tumor maintenance or shrinkage was also significant in mice xenografted with Ba/F3 FLT3-ITD cells (N=5, p<0.001). Mice receiving an intra-bone marrow injection of MV4-11 cells labelled with luciferase began gilteritinib treatment on day 15. Gilteritinib treated mice showed significantly less widespread disease at day 42 than control counterparts (N=10, p<0.001) and significantly improved survival (log-rank, p<0.001).	28516360	PubMed		Mori et al., 2017, Invest New Drugs		4	accepted	8924	55	24	13	28608219	28608351			ENST00000241453.7					75	GRCh37	FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.
