Variant:	Genomic alterations, including single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletion events (indels), copy number alterations (CNV's), structural variants (SVs), and other events that differ from the "normal" genome. 
Evidence statement:	A single idea presented in published literature connecting a variant to its clinical impact or interpretation. 
Evidence type:	The predictive, prognostic or diagnostic association between an evidence statement and a variant. 
Evidence level:	The experimental method from which the evidence statement is derived. Ranging from inferential associations from a single experiment to trusted associations that routinely inform clinical action.  
Evidence direction:	The connecting element between an evidence type and an evidence statement. The direction of a statement is either supporting or refuting the clinical significance of an evidence type.  
Clinical significance:	The sub-type of evidence type that the statement presents. For predictive evidence, a statement can support sensitivity or resistance. For prognositc evidence, a statement can support better or worse outcome. And for diagnostic evidence, a statement can support a diagnosis, or exclude it. 
Evidence Level A:	Trusted association in clinical medicine that routinely informs treatment, including large scale metaanalyses, standard of care associations, and organizational recommendations.  
Evidence Level B:	Clinical evidence from clinical trials and other primary tumor data.
Evidence Level C:	Preclinical evidence from cell line studies, mouse models, and other in vitro or in vivo models. 
Evidence Level D: Case study evidence from individual case reports in peer reviewed journals.
Evidence Level E:	Inferential association made from experimental data. 
Preclinical:	Study using in vivo or in vitro models.
Predictive:	Evidence pertaining to a variant's effect on therapeutic response.
Diagnostic:	Evidence pertaining to a variant's impact on patient diagnosis (cancer subtype).
Prognostic:	Evidence pertaining to a variant's impact on disease progression, severity, or patient survival.
Predisposing: Evidence pertaining to a variant's role in conferring susceptibility to a disease.
CIViC:	Clinical Interpretations of Variants in Cancer
1-star:	Evidence likely does not belong in CIViC. Claim is not supported well by experimental evidence. Results are not reproducible, or have very small sample size. No follow-up is done to validate novel claims. 
2-stars:	Evidence is not well supported by experimental data, and little follow-up data is available. Publication is from a journal with low academic impact. Experiments may lack proper controls, have small sample size, or are not statistically convincing. 
3-stars:	Evidence is convincing, but not supported by a breadth of experiments. May be smaller scale projects, or novel results without many follow-up experiments. Discrepancies from expected results are explained and not concerning. 
4-stars:	Strong, well supported evidence. Experiments are well controlled, and results are convincing. Any discrepancies from expected results are well-explained and not concerning.
5-stars:	Strong, well supported evidence from a lab or journal with respected academic standing. Experiments are well controlled, and results are clean and reproducible across multiple replicates. Evidence confirmed using separate methods.
Substitutes:    The drugs listed are often considered to be of the same family, or behave similarly in a treatment setting
Combination:    The drugs listed were used in as part of a combination therapy approach
Sequential:     The drugs listed were used at separate timepoints in the same treatment plan
Sensitivity:    Evidence that pertains to a response to a therapeutic agent. This includes complete remission, partial response, anti-tumorigenic activity, acheivement of stable disease, and others.
Resistance/Non-response:        Evidence that pertains to a lack of sensitivity to a therapeutic agent. This includes primary refractory disease, acquired resistance upon treatment, and other non-response observations.
